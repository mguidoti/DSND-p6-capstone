AB Soil health is closely related to the soil mite community. Land use
   types can alter the soil environment, which could further influence soil
   biodiversity, including that of soil mites. Soil mites are important
   indicators of soil condition and anthropogenic impact. In order to
   explore the relationship between soil mites and agricultural land use
   types, an experiment was conducted in a traditional agricultural region
   of north China. Four treatments were included: a routine winter
   wheat-summer maize rotation field, a one-year vegetable plastic
   greenhouse, a four-year vegetable greenhouse and a four-year open
   vegetable field. Each treatment was replicated three times. In May and
   October 2012, the soils were sampled to evaluate the changes in soil
   physico-chemical parameters as well as the abundance, diversity and
   community structure of the soil mites. Mite diversity was tested using
   the Shannon-Wiener index and taxonomic richness, and a canonical
   correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to elucidate the relationship
   between the soil mite community, the soil physico-chemical parameters
   and the treatments. The results indicated that the open vegetable field
   significantly increased the hydrolyzable nitrogen content and the
   four-year vegetable greenhouse increased the available phosphorus
   content. The average mite abundances from each plot were 22568 ind/m2 in
   May and 20155 ind/m2 in October. A total of thirty-six soil mite taxon
   groups were identified. Acaridae were the most abundant at 39%. Other
   dominant mite taxa included Tarsonemidae, Pygmephoridae, Microdispidae,
   Laelapidae, Ascidae, Mesostigmata nymph, Scheloribates sp., Tectocepheus
   velatu, Oppiella sp., Oppia sp. 1, Protoribates sp. and oribatid
   juveniles. These dominant taxa accounted for 91% of mite abundances. The
   soil mite community analysis showed that Oribatid mites were dominant in
   the routine agricultural field. From the routine field to the
   greenhouse, the r-strategic Astigmata, especially the Acaridae, became
   the dominant assemblage over the K-strategic oribatid mites, which could
   be attributed to the increase in fertilizer input and human disturbance.
   The succession was obvious in the new built one-year vegetable
   greenhouse treatment. However, the mite diversity and Acaridae abundance
   decreased after the greenhouses were used for four years, which
   suggested that the accumulation of phosphorus and the more frequent
   disturbance were unfavorable conditions for the soil mite community.
   Disturbance also decreased the abundance of Oribatida, Pygmephoridae and
   Microdispidae. From the routine field to the open vegetable field,
   management led to a decrease of Oribatida with the four suborders having
   a similar proportion in the open vegetable field. Compared with the
   vegetable greenhouses, the open vegetable field had a more equable
   distribution of the four treatments. In summary, the most serious
   disturbance and the highest loss of mite diversity occurred in the
   vegetable greenhouses, compared with the other two land use types. This
   loss of mite diversity could destroy soil fertility maintenance and
   self-restoration and have a negative impact on sustainable agricultural
   productivity. Therefore, although greenhouses can increase yield and
   income, we should pay more attention to the protection of soil
   biodiversity in future, especially of the mite community.

AB We evaluated the role of wild large mammals as dispersers of
   fleshy-fruited woody plants in woodland pastures of the Cantabrian range
   (N Spain). By searching for seeds in mammal scats across four
   localities, we addressed how extensive seed dispersal was in relation to
   the fleshy-fruited plant community, and applied a network approach to
   identify the relative role of mammal species in the seed dispersal
   process. We also tested the response of mammalian dispersers to forest
   availability at increasing spatial scales. Five carnivores and three
   ungulates dispersed seeds of eight fleshy-fruited trees and shrubs.
   Mammalian seed dispersal did not mirror community-wide fruit
   availability, as abundant fruiting trees were scarce whereas thorny
   shrubs were over-represented among dispersed species. The dispersal
   network was dominated by bramble (Rubus ulmifolius/fruticosus), the
   remaining plants being rarer and showing more restricted disperser
   coteries. Fox (Vulpes vulpes), badger (Meles meles), and wild boar (Sus
   scrofa) dispersed mostly bramble, whereas martens (Martes sp.) dispersed
   mostly wild rose (Rosa sp.). Ungulates occasionally dispersed holly
   (Ilex aquifolium) and hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna). The empirical
   network reflected a skewed distribution of interactions and some
   functional complementarity (as judged from the low levels of connectance
   and nestedness), but also some degree of specialization. Mammals
   overused uncovered microsites for seed deposition, and increased their
   disperser activity in those landscape sectors devoid of forest. Combined
   with previous findings on avian seed dispersal, this study suggest a
   strong functional complementarity coming from the low overlap in the
   main plant types that mammals and birds disperse - thorny shrubs and
   trees, respectively - and the differential patterns of seed deposition,
   with mammals mostly dispersing into deforested areas, and birds into
   forest-rich landscapes.

AB Tangshanaspis Zhou and Zhang, 1978 (Family Missisquoiidae), has been
   reported widely from western North America and has been assigned
   invariably to a single species, T. depressa (Stitt, 1971b). The base of
   the T. depressa Subzone as defined in Oklahoma is an important
   biostratigraphic datum for inter-regional correlation of uppermost
   Cambrian strata. Study of previously undescribed material in collections
   from Oklahoma shows that T. depressa is, in fact, a composite of
   cranidia and pygidia that belong to two stratigraphically segregated
   species in the Signal Mountain Formation. Tangshanaspis silveri n. sp.
   includes the pygidial morph originally attributed to T. depressa.
   Revision of the species from Oklahoma allows definition of a new
   biostratigraphic unit, the Tangshanaspis Zone, which is divided into a
   lower T. silveri Fauna and an overlying T. depressa Fauna; in addition
   to the eponymous species, the T. depressa Fauna includes pygidia that
   represent two additional species of Tangshanaspis that are placed in
   open nomenclature. Correlation with other areas suggests that the
   "Missisquoia" mackenziensis Fauna of northern Canada may be equivalent
   to the T. silveri Fauna of Oklahoma, rather than a pre-Tangshanaspis
   interval that is unrepresented elsewhere in Laurentian North America.

AB Multivariate analysis of 197 well-preserved specimens among 11 species
   of late Late Ordovician (Katian and Hirnantian) plaesiomyid brachiopods
   from North America revealed two trends of morphological changes: (1)
   increasing globosity and dorsal convexity from the early to late Katian,
   and (2) coarser, but fewer ribs in species from the paleoequatorial
   intracratonic seas compared with species from the mid-to high-tropical
   pericratonic shelves and platforms. Another notable change, albeit not
   quantified, was the enlargement of cardinal process in plaesiomyids from
   early to late Katian, characterized by a predominantly trilobed cardinal
   process in the intracratonic species versus a bilobed cardinal process
   in pericratonic species. Increases in dorsal convexity and shell
   globosity are interpreted to have allowed for development of a larger
   lophophore, improving the capacity and efficiency of filter feeding and
   gas exchange. Smaller but more frequently bifurcating ribs would have
   led to more numerous setae near the margin of the shell, resulting in
   increased sensitivity to environmental stimuli. Increased size and
   number of lobes of the cardinal process would have allowed for larger
   diductor muscles to open a larger, heavier shell. In this study, two new
   species, Plaesiomys periosa sp. nov. and Plaesiomys lenzi sp. nov., are
   proposed, and two existing species are transferred from Dinorthis to
   Plaesiomys.

   widespread oceanic anoxia. High-resolution geochemical proxies (TOC,
   CaCO3, [delta]13Corg, and [delta]13Ccarb) obtained from bulk rock,
   planktic foraminifers, and inoceramids from four marine
   marlstone-dominated stratigraphic sections in the Western Canada
   Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) were used to establish a regional carbon
   isotope stratigraphic framework and to investigate paleoenvironmental
   variability in four different depositional settings. Compared to
   background [delta]13Corg, (<-27[per mill]) and [delta]13Ccarb (<2[per
   mill]) values which were correlative to stable isotope excursions during
   Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) II worldwide, the [delta]13Corg (>24[per
   mill]), and [delta]13Ccarb (>4[per mill]) derived from inoceramid prisms
   in the studied sections within WCSB, were elevated during the Late
   Cenomanian-Early Turonian. During this interval, TOC and CaCO3 values
   which increased sporadically to >40% and 7%, respectively, were not
   consistent enough to be used for stratigraphic correlations. Based on
   the [delta]13Corg excursions, two bentonite beds were regionally
   correlated across this portion of the Western Interior Seaway (WIS). The
   eruption associated with the "Red" bentonite occurred approximately
   coeval with the maximum [delta]13Corg-excursion during OAE II in the
   Neocardioceras juddii Zone, whereas the "Blue" bentonite coincides with
   the termination of OAE II in the latest Watinoceras devonense zone.
   During the Late Cenomanian-Early Turonian in the WCSB, benthic
   foraminifers were sparse or totally absent, indicating the existence of
   fully anoxic bottom-water conditions. Planktic foraminifera were common
   in the well-oxygenated surface waters. A benthic oxic zone characterized
   by several agglutinated species occurs in the eastern part of the WSCB
   at the beginning of OAE II in the Sciponoceras gracile zone. The
   termination of the OAE II in the WCSB coincides with the first
   occurrence of small ammonites (Sub-prionocyclus sp.) in the western part
   of the basin. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Parvodus celsucuspus sp. nov. and the batoid Belemnobatis variabilis.
   The composition of the fauna, including only a single, seemingly
   endemic, hybodont species from a time when hybodont faunas are
   relatively well investigated in Europe, indicate that small hybodonts
   were not able to migrate longer distances. The recorded batoid species
   also occurs in southern England, demonstrating that these batoids were
   primarily marine fishes that regularly explored areas with reduced
   salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Palaeotemperatures during the late Barremian-early Aptian (Early
   Cretaceous) on the Russian Platform have been determined on the basis of
   oxygen isotope analysis of aragonitic bivalve molluscan and ammonoid
   shells and belemnite rostra with well-preserved microstructure from the
   Ulyanovsk area. Those obtained from the planispiral and heteromorph
   ammonoid shells from the lower Aptian Volgensis Schilovkensis,
   Deshayesi-Tuberculatum, and Deshayesi-Renauxianum zones range from 26.7
   to 33.2 [degree]C, from 292 to 33.1 [degree]C, and from 27.0 to 29.5
   [degree]C, respectively. A heteromorph Helicancylus? cf. philadelphius
   shell from the uppermost lower Aptian Bowerbanki Zone was secreted in
   highest temperature conditions (32.8-35.2[degree]C). In contrast, upper
   Barremian molluscs (bivalve Cyprina sp. and belemnite Oxyteuthis sp.) of
   the Ulyanovsk area show significantly lower palaeotemperatures:
   16.9-18.5 [degree]C and 7.9-17.8 [degree]C, respectively, which is in
   accordance with known palaeogeographic and palaeobotanical evidences,
   showing that a distinct climatic optimum seems to have occurred during
   the late early Aptian, when warm Tethyan water penetrated into the
   basin. Marked changes in calculated growth temperatures for investigated
   molluscs from the Russian Platform were most likely connected with both
   the general warming trend during the late Barremian early Aptian and
   local palaeonvironmental conditions. New data from the Bowerbanki Zone
   of the Russian Platform provide evidence on existence of the positive
   carbon isotope anomaly (2.4-6[per mill],) at the end of the lower
   Aptian. There were apparently the three positive C-isotope anomalies
   during the late Barremian early Aptian. The onset of mid early Aptian
   Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) 1 a seems to coincide with both the beginning
   of significant warm conditions (followed by short-term cooling) and the
   abrupt decline in heavy carbon isotope concentrations in marine
   carbonates, which partly were the likely consequences of the intensive
   release of CO2 (biased by volcanic activity) and/or dissociation of
   methane gas hydrate. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   The characters of the anterior cervical vertebrae, the shape of the
   neural canal of the dorsal vertebra and the ball-shaped distal end of
   the neural spine of caudal vertebrae with coarse surfaces differ from
   other long-necked sauropod dinosaurs. The new genus has characters in
   common with both Euhelopus and Erketu; it represents the first
   long-necked sauropod dinosaur recorded from central China to date. The
   rod-like, well-developed epipophyses and the pleurocoels on the cervical
   vertebrae indicate that it may be close to Euhelopus, an observation
   also confirmed by a phylogenetic analysis, which shows that Erketu,
   Yunmenglong and Qiaowanlong form a clade, and are more derived than

   of family Blattulidae that occur at the same locality (CV = 6.22 %; 5.72
   %). The transitional nature of morphological characters represented by

   within the Neotropical genus Micronycteris, the group has yet to be
   fully resolved. In Bolivia Micronycteris is represented by 4 species: M.
   hirsuta, M. megalotis, M. minuta, and M. sanborni. Through examination
   of morphological characters and analyses of cranial measurements and
   genetic data, we determine that M. sanborni is not found in Bolivia and
   describe a new species closely related to it. The new species is
   morphometrically distinct from its congeners, forming a cluster separate
   from M. schmidtorum, M. minuta, and M. brosseti along principal
   component (PC) 1 (explaining 57.3% of the variation and correlated with
   maxillary toothrow length) and also separate from M. sanborni along PC 2
   (explaining 35.4% of the variation and correlated with condylobasal
   length). The new species forms a statistically supported clade in all
   phylogenetic analyses; however, a sister relationship to M. sanborni is
   not supported. Genetic distance values that separate Micronycteris sp.
   nov. from its closest relatives range from 5.3% (versus M. sanborni) to
   10.4% (versus M. minuta from Guyana). We diagnose and describe the new
   species in detail and name it in honor of the late Terry Lamon Yates for
   his contributions to Bolivian mammalogy. Micronycteris sp. nov. is
   Bolivia's 1st endemic bat species and because of its importance, the
   conservation implications are discussed.

AB Early Cretaceous sauropods were among the first dinosaurs discovered in
   North America, but several aspects of their taxonomy and evolution
   remain poorly understood. Much of this ambiguity stems from lack of
   anatomical overlap among taxa and the 125-year-long taxonomic confusion
   surrounding the sauropods Astrodon and Pleurocoelus. New discoveries
   have begun to remedy the first problem, but a lack of autapomorphies in
   their holotypes and skeletal associations among their hypodigms renders
   Astrodon johnstoni, Pleurocoelus altus and Pleurocoelus nanus nomina
   dubia. Herein I examine the affinities of sauropods from the Trinity
   Group of Texas and Oklahoma previously referred to as Pleurocoelus' or
   Astrodon'. Some of this material currently comprises the genera
   Paluxysaurus and Sauroposeidon from laterally equivalent strata in Texas
   and Oklahoma, respectively. Although representative individuals of
   Paluxysaurus are only two-thirds the size of Sauroposeidon, bone
   histology of Paluxysaurus indicates that the individuals from the type
   locality were not near adult size. The similar provenance, lack of
   morphological differences, and shared unique features support referral
   of Paluxysaurus to Sauroposeidon. Other sauropod remains from the
   Trinity Group are not referable to Pleurocoelus', Astrodon' or
   Sauroposeidon. Some of these remains comprise the holotype of
   Astrophocaudia slaughteri gen. et sp. nov., a basal titanosauriform
   diagnosed by a hyposphene-hypantrum system in the caudal vertebrae. A
   sauropod hind limb previously referred to Pleurocoelus' is instead
   referable to Cedarosaurus weiskopfae based on shared features of the
   pes. Cladistic analysis indicates that Astrophocaudia and Sauroposeidon
   are members of Somphospondyli, whereas Cedarosaurus is a brachiosaurid.
   The Trinity Group of Texas and laterally equivalent Antlers Formation of
   Oklahoma exhibit similar dinosaur faunas at the generic and specific
   levels to the Cloverly Formation of Wyoming. This homogeneity with
   respect to latitude stands in marked contrast to the latitudinal
   variation in dinosaur communities that developed later in the
   Cretaceous.

AB The record of Palaeogene cingulate xenarthrans in low latitudes is very
   poor. The cingulate fauna from the Yurua River near Santa Rosa in
   eastern Peru is important because it is one of the oldest known from the
   Palaeogene of Peru and because of its tropical latitudinal position.
   Although remains are scarce, we recognize three new taxa: two species of
   Astegotheriini (Dasypodidae); Parastegosimpsonia peruana gen. et sp.
   nov., of small size, related to Eocene species from Patagonia; and
   another new species, ?Parastegosimpsonia sp. nov., which consists of an
   incomplete osteoderm representing the largest species of this tribe. A
   third species, Yuruatherium tropicalis gen. et sp. nov., of
   indeterminate suprageneric rank, shares features with Machlydotherium
   Ameghino (Casamayoran-Tinguirirican SALMA - middle Eocene-early
   Oligocene of Patagonia) and is similar to Eocoleophorus Oliveira etal.
   (Deseadan SALMA - late Oligocene of Brazil). We assign ?Machlydotherium
   intortum Ameghino (from the late Eocene of Patagonia) to Yuruatherium.
   Sediments bearing these cingulates also yielded rodents, marsupials and
   notoungulates, among the most frequent mammals. The absolute age of the
   sediments is unknown but an estimated age is inferred from studies of
   the mammalian assemblages. The age of the Santa Rosa local fauna is
   still controversial and given the groups taken into account, could be
   from Early Eocene to Late Oligocene. According to sequences of southern
   cingulate faunas (especially those of Dasypodidae), the cingulates from
   Santa Rosa also suggest an age between the Late Eocene and Early
   Oligocene. Nevertheless, the very low latitude of the Santa Rosa local
   fauna should be taken into account because in lower latitudes it is not
   uncommon to find taxa with a more generalized set of characters than
   those present in contemporary taxa from higher latitudes.

AB Phylogenetic relationships and taxonomy of the short-necked turtles of
   the genera Elseya, Myuchelys, and Emydura in Australia and New Guinea
   have long been debated as a result of conflicting hypotheses supported
   by different data sets and phylogenetic analyses. To resolve this
   contentious issue, we analyzed sequences from two mitochondrial genes
   (cytochrome b and ND4) and one nuclear intron gene (R35) from all
   species of the genera Elseya, Myuchelys, Emydura, and their relatives.
   Phylogenetic analyses using three methods (maximum parsimony, maximum
   likelihood, and Bayesian inference) produce a single, well resolved, and
   strongly corroborated hypothesis, which provides support for the three
   genera, with the exception that the genus Myuchelys is paraphyletic -
   Myuchelys purvisi is the sister taxon to the remaining Elseya, Myuchelys
   and Emydura. A new genus is proposed for the species Myuchelys purvisi
   to address this paraphyletic relationship. Time-calibration analysis
   suggests that diversification of the group in Australia coincides with
   periods of aridification in the late Eocene and between the mid-Miocene
   and early Pliocene. Other speciation events occurred during the faunal
   exchange between Australia and the island of New Guinea during the late
   Miocene and early Pliocene. Lineages distributed in New Guinea are
   likely influenced by the complex geologic history of the island, and
   include cryptic species diversity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   for the first time. Endoparasitic copepods on fish hosts are extremely
   rare and the impact of colonization of this novel microhabitat on the
   biology of the parasite is discussed. This curious association was
   reported from two different host families of Neotropical freshwater
   fishes, Erythrinidae and Cichlidae, collected from the Cristalino River,
   a tributary of the Araguaia River, in Brazil. The copepod is fully
   described using light and scanning electron microscopy. Urogasilus
   brasiliensis n. g., n. sp. represents a new genus and species of the
   family Ergasilidae and can be distinguished from other genera by its
   unique tagmosis, in which the fourth and fifth pedigerous somites and
   the genital double-somite are all fused to form an elongate trunk. The
   anal somite is the only free abdominal somite present. The pattern of
   leg segmentation is also unique, with legs 1 to 3 each having a
   2-segmented endopod and leg 4 reduced to a single seta. The discovery of
   ovigerous female ergasilids in the urinary bladder of a fish is novel
   and this discovery represents a good model for further studies on the

AB Until now, four species of eye trematodes have been found in South
   America. Of them, Philophthalmus lucipetus (synonymized with
   Philophthalmus gralli) displays a broad host spectrum, with at least 30
   bird species (prevalently large water birds), five mammal species and
   humans serving as definitive hosts, and with snails Fagotia
   (Microcolpia) acicularis, Amphimelania holandri, Melanopsis praemorsa
   and Melanoides tuberculata serving as intermediate hosts. When examining
   a total of 50 birds of ten species in the wetland of Pantanos de Villa,
   Lima, Peru in July 2011, eye trematodes were identified visually in the
   edematous conjunctival sac of 11 (48%) out of 23 resident many-colored
   rush tyrants Tachuris rubrigastra. Based on morphometric
   characteristics, the trematodes were identified as P. lucipetus. ITS2
   and CO1 gene of the examined specimens combined showed a 99% similarity
   to an Iranian isolate of Philophthalmus sp. from the intermediate host
   Melanoides tuberculata, an invasive freshwater snail, suggesting that
   these two isolates represent the same species with a wide geographical
   range. Moreover, the prevalence of infection with the philophthalmid
   cercariae was 31% in 744 Melanoides tuberculata examined in Pantanos de
   Villa in 2010. It is evident that P. lucipetus occurs throughout the
   world as well as locally, including Eurasia and South America. Here we
   report this trematode for the first time in Peru, and we were the first
   to sequence any of the South American eye trematodes. Low host
   specificity of P. lucipetus and the invasive character of Melanoides
   tuberculata as a competent intermediate host suggest that eye
   trematodosis caused by P. lucipetus may emerge frequently in various
   parts of the world, especially in the tropics. Increase of the zoonotic
   potential of the P. lucipetus associated with this invasive snail
   spreading across the world is predictable and should be of interest for
   further research.. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The taxonomic history and species composition of the genus Clinostomum
   has been unstable. Two species, Clinostomum complanatum Rudolphi, 1814
   and Clinostomum marginatum Rudolphi, 1819, have been particularly
   problematic and its validity has been disputed for nearly 200 years. In
   this paper, we have made use of an integrative taxonomy approach, and we
   used, in first instance, DNA sequences of two genes (cox1 and ITS) to
   test the validity of C. complanatum, a species apparently widely
   distributed in Mexico and to link the metacercariae and adult forms of
   the recognized species of Clinostomum. Combining molecular data with
   morphology, host association, and geographical distribution, we searched
   for the potential existence of undescribed species. A new species of
   Clinostomum is described based on adults found in the mouthy cavity of
   three species of fish-eating birds as well as in metacercariae found in
   freshwater and estuarine fishes. A few morphological characteristics
   distinguish the new species from other congeners even though reciprocal
   monophyly in a phylogenetic tree based on maximum-likelihood and
   Bayesian analysis, genetic divergence, and a multivariate analysis of
   variance and a principal component analysis of 18 morphometric traits
   for adults and metacercariae demonstrates the validity of the new
   species. Based on our results, it seems that C. complanatum is not
   currently distributed in Mexico, although this requires further
   verification with a more thoroughful sampling in other areas of the
   country, but it is plausible to support the hypothesis that C.
   marginatum is the American form, as previously suggested by other
   authors.

   from the helmeted guinea fowls, Numida meliagris Linn. 1758 in Kruger
   National Park and elsewhere in subSaharan Africa from the same and other
   galliform birds. These specimens were previously assigned to
   Mediorhynchus gallinarum Bhaleroa (Proc Zool Soc Lond Ser B Syst Morph
   107:199-203, 1937) described from chickens, Gallus gallus L. in India
   and subsequently reported from other Asian countries. The identification
   of the African forms as M. gallinarum was based on similarities in the
   structure and measurements of the proboscis, proboscis armature and
   receptacle, lemnisci, and reproductive organs. A detailed study of
   specimens from South Africa and descriptions reported from elsewhere in
   Africa revealed marked differences that clearly distinguish the African
   material as new species. The African specimens are pseudo-segmented and
   flattened, the proboscis has two prominent apical pores, sensory pits
   are prevalent throughout the trunk, the posterior end of the female is
   broad with dorso-terminal dome-like extension opposite the subterminal
   gonopore, and the eggs are large. The Asian specimens from Indonesia and
   elsewhere are cylindrical and non-segmented, the proboscis lacks
   prominent apical pores, sensory pits are rare on the trunk, the
   posterior end of the female is pointed with a terminal gonopore, and the
   eggs are markedly smaller. We used DNA sequence from one mitochondrial
   gene (cytochrome oxidase subunit I) and one nuclear gene (18S ribosomal
   RNA) to infer the phylogenetic relationships of M. africanus and M.
   gallinarum and selected Acanthocephala. Medioryhnchus is monophyletic
   and M. africanus and M. gallinarum are allopatric sister species (9.7 %
   sequence divergence). All findings indicate that M. africanus should be
   ranked as a separate species.

AB Acanthamoeba, an opportunistic protozoan pathogen, is ubiquitous in
   nature, and therefore plays a predatory role and helps control microbial
   communities in the ecosystem. These Acanthamoeba species are recognized
   as opportunistic human pathogens that may cause blinding keratitis and
   rare but fatal granulomatous encephalitis. To date, there is not a
   single report demonstrating Acanthamoeba isolation and identification
   from environmental sources in Pakistan, and that is the aim of this
   study. Acanthamoeba were identified by morphological characteristics of
   their cysts on non-nutrient agar plates seeded with Escherichia coli.
   Additionally, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with
   genus-specific primers followed by direct sequencing of the PCR product
   for molecular identification. Furthermore, our PCR and sequencing
   results confirmed seven different pathogenic and nonpathogenic
   genotypes, including T2-T10, T4, T5, T7, T15, T16, and T17. To the best
   of our knowledge, we have identified and isolated Acanthamoeba sp., for
   the first time, from water resources of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.
   There is an urgent need to address (1) the pathogenic potential of the
   identified genotypes and (2) explore other environmental sources from
   the country to examine the water quality and the current status of
   Acanthamoeba species in Pakistan, which may be a potential threat for

AB A survey of the myxosporean fauna of Australian marine fishes revealed
   the presence of three previously unreported species of Unicapsula
   (Multivalvulida: Trilosporidae) from sites off Southeast Queensland, off
   Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, and from Jurien Bay
   in Western Australia. Morphometric data (spore, polar capsule and caudal
   appendage dimensions) combined with Bayesian inference and maximum
   likelihood analyses of small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU)
   ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were used for species identification and to explore
   relationships among these taxa. The four species of Unicapsula for which
   DNA data are now available for comparative purposes (Unicapsula
   andersenae n. sp., Unicapsula pflugfelderi, Unicapsula seriolae and
   Unicapsula pyramidata) formed a well-supported monophyletic sister clade
   to the other major multivalvulidan group, the Kudoidae. The combined
   morphometric and genetic diagnostic approach identified an undescribed
   taxon, U. andersenae n. sp., from the muscle of Argyrosomus japonicus,
   Acanthopagrus australis and Eleutheronema tetradactylum off the
   Southeast Queensland coast and in Lutjanus russellii and Sillago ciliata
   off Lizard Island. Intra-specific variation within U. andersenae n. sp.
   varied from 2-4 (0.2-0.4 %) nucleotides over the SSU region to 2-20
   (0.3-3.2 %) over the LSU region. Inter-specific variation between U.
   andersenae n. sp. and the other three species for which genetic sequence
   data are now available ranged from 15-66 (3-6.5 %) nucleotides over the
   SSU region to 103-120 (17.6-21.2 %) nucleotides over the LSU region. The
   host distribution observed here for U. andersenae n. sp. (five fish
   species from five different fish families) represents the broadest
   specificity known for a single species of Unicapsula. U. pyramidata
   Naidjenova & Zaika 1970, whose spore morphology and presence of caudal
   appendages immediately distinguish it from other species, was recovered
   from the nemipterid, Scolopsis monogramma, off Lizard Island. U.
   seriolae Lester 1982 is reported here from Yellowtail Kingfish, Seriola
   lalandi, from sites off Queensland and from Jurien Bay, Western
   Australia. Comparative genetic analyses also revealed that an
   unidentified species of Unicapsula from Epinephelus septemfasciatus off
   Japan whose rDNA sequence data are available on GenBank is consistent
   with U. seriolae. This suggests that U. seriolae may also exhibit low
   host specificity and may be distributed widely throughout the Indo-West
   Pacific region. In comparison to other myxozoan genera, it is clear that
   the species richness of Unicapsula spp. falls well below that displayed
   by either Ceratomyxa spp. or Kudoa spp. The discovery of a further new
   species of Unicapsula in Australia now brings the total worldwide number
   of formally described Unicapsula species to a modest 11. Nonetheless,
   this taxon remains of significant interest to commercial and
   recreational fisheries through the potential production of macroscopic
   pseudocysts in fish muscle and post-mortem muscle liquefaction, both of
   which can render fish fillets unpalatable and unmarketable.

   lineata reared in aquaculture in Tasmania, Australia, and those sampled
   from the wild revealed the presence of epitheliocystis-like basophilic
   inclusions. Subsequent morphological, in situ hybridization, and
   molecular analyses were performed to confirm the presence of this
   disease and discovered a Chlamydia-like organism associated with this
   condition, and the criteria set by Fredericks and Relman's postulates
   were used to establish disease causation. Three distinct 16S rRNA
   genotypes were sequenced from 16 fish, and phylogenetic analyses of the
   nearly full-length 16S rRNA sequences generated for this bacterial agent
   indicated that they were nearly identical novel members of the order
   Chlamydiales. This new taxon formed a well-supported clade with
   "Candidatus Parilichlamydia carangidicola" from the yellowtail kingfish
   (Seriola lalandi). On the basis of sequence divergence over the 16S rRNA
   region relative to all other members of the order Chlamydiales, a new
   genus and species are proposed here for the Chlamydia-like bacterium
   from L. lineata, i.e., "Candidatus Similichlamydia latridicola" gen.

   analysis of both extinct and extant taxa resulted in the following

   of the extant tribe Arrowinini; extinct basal lineages of the extant
   tribe Staphylinini; two stem genera of the "antholinine- lineage"

   of which now represent extant tribes but not the branches dominating in
   the modern biota. While the study of the Early Cretaceous rove beetle
   fauna pushes the estimated divergence time between Paederinae and
   Staphylininae down into the Jurassic, it also suggests that presently
   hyperdiverse groups of Staphylininae originated some time later than the
   Early Cretaceous. In addition to one new tribe, five new genera

AB Serine proteases (SPs), with their homologues (SPHs), a family of

   In our present study, we made an appropriate correction: serine protease
   homologue PtcSPH (Li et al., (1)) obtained from the swimming crab
   Portunus trituberculatus was actually a serine protease and
   re-designated as PtcSP. Sequence analysis revealed PtcSP and PtSP (Li et
   al., (2)) might be encoded by the same genomic locus and generated by
   alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA. Eight exons were identified in
   genomic DNA sequence of PtcSP. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis was
   made combined with our previous reports (Cui et al., (3); Li et al.,
   (1,2)). The result showed SPs and SPHs of P. trituberculatus had
   different origins in gene evolution. To further characterize the
   function(s) of proteins, the recombinant serine proteases or homologues
   were assayed for various biological functions: proteinase activity,
   antimicrobial activity and microorganisms binding activity. The
   recombinant protein PtcSP exhibited trypsin-like protease activity and
   antibacterial activity. PtSPH1 (Li et al., (2)) lacked proteolytic
   activity but displayed binding activity to yeast and the crab pathogenic
   bacterium, Vibrio alginolyticus. Further, the N-terminal clip domain of
   PtcSP had antibacterial activity and the C-terminal SP-like domain had
   trypsin-like protease activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Perkinsus genus includes protozoan parasites of marine mollusks,
   especially bivalves. In the last four years, this parasite has been
   detected in mangrove oysters Crassostrea rhizophorae and Crassostrea
   gasar from the Northeastern region of Brazil. Hemocytes are the key
   cells of the oyster immune system, being responsible for a variety of
   cellular and humoral reactions, such as phagocytosis, encapsulation and
   the release of several effector molecules that control the invasion and
   proliferation of microorganisms. In Brazil, there is little information
   on perkinsosis and none on the immune responses of native oysters'
   species against Perkinsus spp. The objective of this study was to
   determine the effects of natural infection by Perkinsus sp. on the
   immunological parameters of mangrove oysters C gasar cultured in the
   Mamanguape River Estuary (Paraiba, Brazil). Adults oysters (N =
   40/month) were sampled in December 2011, March, May, August and October
   2012. Gills were removed and used to determine the presence and
   intensity of the Perkinsus sp. infection, according to a scale of four
   levels (1-4), using the Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium assay.
   Immunological parameters were measured in hemolymph samples by flow
   cytometry, including: total hemocyte count (THC), differential hemocyte
   count (DHC), cell mortality, phagocytic capacity, and production of
   Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). The plasma was used to determine the
   hemagglutination activity. The results showed the occurrence of
   Perkinsus sp. with the highest mean prevalence (93.3%) seen so far in
   oyster populations in Brazil. Despite that, no oyster mortality was
   associated. In contrast, we observed an increase in hemocyte mortality
   and a suppression of two of the main defense mechanisms, phagocytosis
   and ROS production in infected oysters. The increase in the percentage
   of blast-like cells on the hemolymph, and the increase in THC in oysters
   heavily infected (at the maximum intensity, 4) suggest an induction of
   hemocytes proliferation. The immunological parameters varied over the
   studied months, which may be attributed to the dynamics of infection by
   Perkinsus sp. The results of the present study demonstrate that
   Perkinsus sp. has a deleterious effect on C gasar immune system, mainly
   in high intensities, which likely renders oysters more susceptible to
   other pathogens and diseases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Sweat bees are one of the most socially polymorphic lineages on the
   planet. In obligately eusocial species, newly enclosed females may
   become either queens or workers, depending on the environmental and
   social circumstances of the nest into which they emerge. In socially
   polymorphic species, females also have the option of nesting solitarily,
   founding a nest and raising future reproductives alone, without the help
   of other adult females. Halictus ligatus is a widespread Nearctic,
   ground-nesting sweat bee. It has been particularly well studied in
   Ontario, where detailed studies have described it as obligately
   eusocial. Here we report evidence that the flexibility of female H.
   ligatus actually extends to expressing behaviour more typical of
   socially polymorphic species, those in which some individuals reproduce
   solitarily. In a population in southern Ontario, black wasps (Astata
   sp.) emerged from the soil beneath the nesting aggregation and proceeded
   to excavate their own nesting tunnels, dislocating many H. ligatus nest
   entrances. Young workers whose natal nests were destroyed by the wasp
   activity constructed new nests, so under very specific circumstances, it
   is possible for potential altruists to nest solitarily.

   and has since established and spread. Nondestructive monitoring of grape
   vine sections was conducted in untreated vineyard plots and compared
   with destructive sampling conducted in grower-treated plots in 2008 and
   2009 to determine F. gilli life stage seasonal presence, number of
   generations, location on the vine during the season, and damage
   potential to fruit clusters. Two generations were observed to be
   completed during the season. F. gilli overwintered under the bark at the
   base of the trunk, trunk, and cordon as second and third instars. Adults
   were found at the base of emerging shoots (spring) or on and under bark
   of old and new spurs. Live crawlers were born in June (first generation)
   and late August to September (second generation), and migrated to leaves
   to feed before moving to protected locations under bark or into fruit
   clusters. Lower mealybug densities and fruit damage were recorded on
   vines with than without insecticide treatment(s). Parasitized mealybugs
   were collected in low numbers and an Acerophagus sp. was the dominant
   parasitoid.

AB Pristionchus pacificus Sommer, Carta, Kim, and Sternberg, 1996 is an
   important model organism in evolutionary biology that integrates
   developmental biology with ecology and population genetics. This species
   is part of a sub-complex of the genus Pristionchus that is considered to
   have originated in East Asia. Here, we describe two new species of
   Pristionchus, P. maxplancki and P. quartusdecimus, which were isolated
   from beetles in Japan, supporting the hypothesis that a region including
   Japan is the origin of diversification of the P. pacificus species
   complex. Phylogeny inferred from a partial small subunit rRNA gene and
   25 ribosomal protein genes shows P. maxplancki to be the closest known
   outgroup to a triad of sibling species, including P. pacificus.
   Pristionchus quartusdecimus is a putative outgroup to the P. pacificus
   species complex, supporting a more ancient origin of Pristionchus
   species in the region. Species diagnoses are based on morphological and
   molecular characters, in addition to reproductive isolation for P.
   maxplancki. Members of the P. pacificus species complex as well as P.
   quartusdecimus are distinguished by stegostomatal structures, male
   genital papilla arrangement, and gubernaculum shape. The discovery of a
   new member of the P. pacificus species complex allows greater precision
   in polarizing and reconstructing ancestral states in the comparative
   model system centering on P. pacificus. Together with previous reports,
   these findings support an important biogeographic role of Japan in the
   evolution of the genus Pristionchus and the P. pacificus species
   complex, especially the associated phenotypic evolution of mouth
   morphology.

AB The implementation of molecular tools in parasitology has led to the
   discovery of numerous cryptic species. However, detailed morphological
   studies are needed to evaluate the cryptic nature of such species, as
   well as to provide an appropriate and formal description. Recent
   phylogenetic analyses using mitochondrial and nuclear genes have
   revealed that the nematode Spauligodon atlanticus, parasite of lizards
   of the genus Gallotia endemic to the Canary Islands, consists of two
   highly divergent and unrelated lineages, one in the eastern islands and
   the other in the western ones. This study provides a detailed
   morphological analysis of the two S. atlanticus lineages characterized
   genetically, based on body measurements and scanning electron
   microscopy. This integrative approach revealed phenotypic differences
   between them, despite their overall morphological resemblance. As a
   result, the new species Spauligodon occidentalis sp. nov., from the
   formerly western lineage, is described. The morphological similarity
   between the two Spauligodon species is better explained on the basis of
   evolutionary convergence, since both species parasitize Gallotia
   lizards. In addition to delimiting the new nematode species, this study
   highlights the importance of combining genetic and morphological data
   with taxonomy to uncover the nature of cryptic species and decrease
   taxonomic uncertainty.

   splitting Leptynia Pantel on the basis of several distinguishing
   features. In addition to Pijnackeria hispanica, the tetraploid
   all-female type species, molecular, karyological and SEM investigations
   led to the recognition of four bisexual and one triploid unisexual new
   species. Bisexuals' karyotypes (2n = 37/38) differ for minute traits and
   the haploid set is repeated, with few differences, three or four times
   in the polyploids that appeared to be of hybrid origin. Diagnostic
   morphological traits were found among body size parameters, antennal
   articles, male cerci, ovipositor valve and egg chorionic features. All
   species commonly feed on the broom Sarothamnus scoparius, but habitat
   disturbance appeared to induce food plant shifts. Moreover, trends from
   bisexuality to unisexuality through spanandry, probably related to
   habitat disruption, have been witnessed. The diploid species
   (Pijnackeria lucianae, Pijnackeria barbarae, Pijnackeria lelongi and
   Pijnackeria originis) have small ranges, while the polyploid hybrids
   (Pijnackeria masettii and P. hispanica) spread through Spain and
   Southern France, featuring a clear geographic parthenogenesis scenario,
   by colonizing wide areas and likely displacing their ancestors, or even
   leading them to extinction. Cyclic climatic changes and natural or
   anthropic habitat fragmentation may have been also of relevance in
   shaping present-day distribution.

   bioactive secondary metabolites. Numerous genera of marine actinomycetes
   have been isolated from marine sediments as well as several sponge
   species. In this study, 16 different species of Caribbean sponges were
   collected from four different locations in the coastal waters off Puerto
   Rico in order to examine diversity and bioactive metabolite production
   of marine actinomycetes in Caribbean sponges. Sediments were also
   collected from each location, in order to compare actinomycete
   communities between these two types of samples. A total of 180
   actinomycetes were isolated and identified based on 16S rRNA gene
   analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of at least 14 new
   phylotypes belonging to the genera Micromonospora, Verruscosispora,
   Streptomyces, Salinospora, Solwaraspora, Microbacterium and
   Cellulosimicrobium. Seventy-eight of the isolates (19 from sediments and
   59 from sponges) shared 100 % sequence identity with Micromonospora sp.
   R1. Despite having identical 16S rRNA sequences, the bioactivity of
   extracts and subsequent fractions generated from the fermentation of
   both sponge- and sediment-derived isolates identical to Micromonospora
   sp. R1 varied greatly, with a marked increase in antibiotic metabolite
   production in those isolates derived from sponges. These results
   indicate that the chemical profiles of isolates with high 16S rRNA
   sequence homology to known strains can be diverse and dependent on the
   source of isolation. In addition, seven previously reported
   dihydroquinones produced by five different Streptomyces strains have
   been purified and characterized from one Streptomyces sp. strain
   isolated in this study from the Caribbean sponge Agelas sceptrum.

AB Proliferations of periphyton associated with the ecological degradation
   of streams have been linked to changes in flow regime, most frequently
   as a product of water abstraction and impoundment. We used descriptive
   and experimental studies to examine the relationship between water
   velocity and the distribution of two distinct, often high biomass,
   periphyton patch types and associated macroinvertebrate communities in
   the Waipara River, a meso-eutrophic stream in Canterbury, New Zealand.
   One patch type (Phormidium') consisted mainly of two filamentous
   cyanobacterial taxa: a Phormidium/Lyngbya complex and Oscillatoria. The
   other type (filamentous greens') consisted mainly of several filamentous
   chlorophyte taxa (Mougeotia sp.) along with various diatom epiphytes.
   Ash-free dry mass, chlorophyll a and particulate N and P concentrations
   were significantly greater in the Phormidium than in the filamentous
   green patches. There was a significant relationship between patch cover
   and water velocity, with filamentous greens negatively associated with
   velocity and dominant in areas with a velocity <[approximately
   equal]0.20ms-1, while Phormidium was dominant at velocities
   >[approximately equal]0.40ms-1. A 7-day experimental reduction in
   velocity in Phormidium-dominated habitats resulted in a significant
   reduction in% cover (84-21%) with a corresponding increase in
   filamentous greens (16-79%). There was a small but significant reduction
   in the % cover of filamentous greens (90-82%) with experimentally
   increased velocity, but no significant change in Phormidium cover
   (7-2%), perhaps due in part to the slow growth rate of taxa in this
   patch type. Characterisation of macroinvertebrate assemblages collected
   from Phormidium and filamentous green patches and the substratum
   immediately below showed patch-specific assemblages, although patch type
   was a less important determinant than vertical location, with 85% of the
   macroinvertebrates found in the substratum below algal mats. The
   differential responses of Phormidium and filamentous green patches to
   velocity are considered in the context of a subsidy-stress model that
   examines how trade-offs between flow-mediated biomass accrual and loss
   processes vary for different algal growth forms. Collectively, these
   results indicated that key ecological characteristics of rivers can be
   quite sensitive to spatial and temporal variations in hydraulic
   conditions that are much smaller than those typical of floods and
   droughts.

   of the new genus is a hemipenis with a poorly sclerified lobe "g", and

   nov. from Lake Biwa. This species was originally described in
   Fabaeformiscandona, fabaeformis-group. They differ mostly in the
   morphology of the shell, but also some details of soft body, including
   the more pronounced genital process in the Korean species. Typhlocypris
   pratensis was so far known from Europe and this finding significantly
   broadens its area of distribution. Both Typhlocypris and Earicandona
   belong to the tribe Candonini and the key to the genera of this tribe is
   also presented here.

   Cladophyllia. Actinastraeopsis forms phaceloid colonies made of densely
   packed thin branches. These colonies may reach large dimensions and form
   bioherms measuring several meters in width and height. Actinastraeopsis
   specimens show a large variation in their calicular dimensions, whereas
   the number of septa is regular within colonies and shows little
   variation. Septal counts and calicular dimensions are mainly used to
   distinguish species. To cope with variation within Actinastraeopsis
   species, the available material was systematically measured and
   statistically analysed. About fifty samples from numerous worldwide
   localities ranging from the Hauterivian to the Middle Albian were
   included.

AB With the recent designation of the holotype of Centrura flagellifer Bell
   as the neotype of Phymaturus palluma Molina by the International
   Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, the type locality of P. palluma
   became problematic. It is likely that Charles Darwin collected the
   holotype of C. flagellifer during his round trip journey between
   Santiago, Chile and Mendoza, Argentina. A detailed account of his
   journey is presented, as well as the conclusion that the type locality
   is Cordon del Portillo, Mendoza province, Argentina, where Darwin
   collected and briefly characterized a viviparous lizard. Here we provide
   a re-description of Darwin's specimen and two morphological characters
   that distinguish it from other populations in Chile and Argentina
   previously assigned to this species. In November 2009, specimens from
   the locality where Darwin collected his "viviparous lizard" were
   collected, confirming the identity of the type. This study also reveals
   that P. gynechlomus should be considered a junior synonym of P. palluma.
   Populations of Phymaturus of the palluma group farther to the north,
   from the Sierra de Uspallata and southern San Juan province, are
   determined to be different lineages and should be described formally.
   The name P. adrianae has been applied to the species that occurs in the
   Sierra de Uspallata, but we show here that it has not been formally
   named and is therefore a nomen nudum. Chilean populations previously
   considered to be P. palluma should be described formally.

   views, calcar appendix and supra-cloacal crest absent, webbing poorly
   developed between fingers, moderately developed between toes, and dorsal
   color pattern composed of four wide pale brown stripes, intercalated by
   three brown stripes, arranged longitudinally. The four pale brown
   stripes join to form two stripes anterior to the eyes and then join
   again at the tip of snout. Within these pale brown stripes, narrow
   longitudinal brown lines, complete or broken, occur. The pale brown
   marginal stripes show, on the external border, a white line passing over
   the canthus rostralis, edge of the upper eyelid, and along the flank to
   the groin, contrasting with a broad dark brown lateral stripe. This dark
   brown stripe extends from the tip of snout to the eye and from the
   posterior border of the eye, passing on the tympanum, to the groin. The
   ventral half of the loreal region is pale brown with a dark brown
   longitudinal line, continuing as a white stripe below and contrasting to
   the dark brown lateral stripe, to the groin. The new species is
   distributed in the extreme south of the State of Rio de Janeiro and
   northeastern State of Sao Paulo, above 400 m altitude.

   from Puntarenas, Costa Rica (C. simplex group). Costatrichia ipixuna sp.
   nov. is most similar to C. noite Angrisano, 1995, but can be
   distinguished by the shallower U-shaped incision on posterior margin of
   sternum VIII, by the absence of the lateral projection of the same
   segment bearing very long setae, and by the phallus with a pair of
   spine-like sclerotized processes apically. Costatrichia falsa sp. nov.
   is most similar to C. zopilote Harris & Holzenthal, 1999, but differs
   from it by the median pair of spines of segment VIII, directed mesad and
   curved posteriorly crossing over each other; by the irregular posterior
   margin of segment VIII, in ventral view; by the segment X without short
   lateral paired spines; and by the flange-like apical processes on
   phallus. In addition, we provide the first record of C. noite Angrisano,
   1995 from Brazil (state of Amazonas).

   Atlantic and Southeast Pacific and to identify parasites of potential
   value as biological tags for stock identification and migrations. In
   2007 a total of 76 hoki were examined from three locations, two off the
   coast of Chile and one off the Falkland Islands. Two further samples
   were taken in 2009, one of 32 hoki taken from a position off the coast
   of Chile between those sampled in 2007 and one of 42 juvenile hoki taken
   off the Falkland Islands. Seventeen different parasite taxa were
   recorded, including eight identified to species. Seven were new host
   records for hoki, and at least three, and possibly as many as five, are
   new species. The most promising tag parasites for hoki stock
   identification are the long-lived larvae of the cestodes Hepatoxylon
   trichiuri and Pseudophyllidea gen. sp. and of the nematode Anisakis sp.
   Three others - the myxosporean Myxidium baueri, the nematode
   Pseudascarophis sp. and the acanthocephalan Echinorhynchus
   longiproboscis - were identified as potentially useful for following
   seasonal migrations of hoki and for estimating the proportions of fish
   of different origin in mixed samples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   three valid species. Brachypterois serrulifer Fowler 1938, previously
   regarded as a junior synonym of Sebastes serrulatus Richardson 1846, can
   be distinguished from its congeners by having usually 16 pectoral-fin
   rays (vs. 15 in the congeners) and 0-22 spines on the median lateral
   ridge of the maxilla (vs. almost always absent), in addition to longer
   dorsal-and anal-fin soft rays, relatively fewer large dark spots on the
   caudal fin, and the posterior lacrimal spines usually directed
   ventrally. Brachypterois curvispina sp. nov., described on the basis of
   32 specimens, can be distinguished from B. serrulata (Richardson 1846)
   by having fewer number of scale rows in the longitudinal series 41-45
   (vs. 44-51 in B. serrulata); relatively long head, its length 41.6-44.5
   (mean 43.1)% SL (vs. 38.3-43.1 (mean 40.2)% SL); posterior lacrimal
   spines usually directed posteriorly, with the tip curved strongly upward
   in large males (vs. simply directed posteroventrally); and posteriorly
   directed spine(s) on the posterior corner of the outer angular ridge
   (vs. directed ventrally). Brachypterois serrulifer is distributed widely
   in the Indo-West Pacific, whereas distributional ranges of B. curvispina
   sp. nov. and B. serrulata are restricted to northeastern Australia and
   the northwestern Pacific, respectively. Intraspecific variation,
   including sexual dimorphism and ontogenetic changes in the three species
   are described in detail. A neotype, collected from southern Taiwan, is
   designated for S. serrulatus Richardson 1846.

   is described from localities in the central and western Congo basin. The
   new species is a fin-eater even at small sizes and, in common with
   congeners, is capable of biting off sections of heavily ossified
   fin-rays of large prey species. Prior to the present study, two species
   were included in this distinctive distichodontid genus: the type
   species, Eugnathichthys eetveldii, and a second species, E.
   macroterolepis, both of which are widely distributed throughout much of
   the Congo basin. Morphologically, E. virgatus is readily distinguished
   from its two congeners based on a combination of meristic and
   morphometric attributes. The new species possesses a unique pigmentation
   pattern, a reduced number of pectoral-fin rays, and a markedly reduced
   dentition on the fifth ceratobranchial elements of the pharynx, all of
   which are derived features considered diagnostic for the new species.
   With molecular data the species is further diagnosed by four apomorphic,
   non-synonomous nucleotide transitions in two sampled genes (NADH
   dehydrogenase subunit 2 and glycosyltransferase). Phylogenetic analysis
   of those mtDNA and ncDNA markers supports a sister-group relationship
   between E. virgatus and E. eetveldii rather than with E. macroterolepis,
   the species with which it bears closest phenetic similarity.

   an idiosoma clothed in 99 dark, dorsal setae; has up to 5 pairs of
   scutalae all longer than 100 microns and a scutum much wider (W) than
   long (L), (L: W=0.673). All legs are long;>800 microns and genua I bears
   one [sigma] solenidion. It is most similar to Erythrites reginae (Hirst,
   1928) and Erythrites urrbrae (Womersley, 1934), both Australian species.

   formidabile is the first subanophthalmous and presumably hypogean
   Lathrobium species to be recorded from China. Three additional, probably
   undescribed species from the Xiling Xue Shan remain unnamed, since only
   females or teneral males are currently available. The depository of the

AB Andrena (Micrandrena) dourada nov.sp. from Porto Santo, Madeira
   Archipelago, Portugal is described. A. diagnosis of this species
   differing from that of its closest relative, A. wollastoni COCKERELL
   1922 (endemic to Madeira Island), is presented. Different morphological
   features are primarily found in body length, wing length, facial fovea
   index, clypeus length, stigma length and propodeum length. A. wollastoni
   and A. dourada share high morphological similarity with A. tiaretta
   WARNCKE 1974 distributed in southern Spain, North Africa, Israel and
   Syria. This is especially true for male genitalia morphology. We group
   A. wollastoni and A. dourada in the subgenus Micrandrena, but some
   morphological features of the subgenus Distandrena occur. Further
   information regarding distribution, habitats, flight time and
   flower-visiting behaviour of A. dourada is given and evolutionary and
   biogeographical aspects are discussed.

   beak-like cerci, well-lineated black and pale yellow pterothorax, and
   penile 4th segment with longer and apically upcurved cornua. This new
   species is distinct among its congeners in view of both biogeography and

AB Krobia petitella, new species, is described from the Berbice River
   drainage of northeastern Guyana. It is distinguished from all other
   described species of Krobia (K. guianensis Regan, K. itanyi Puyo and K.
   xinguensis Kullander) as well as the closely related 'Aequidens'
   potaroensis and 'A'. paloemeuensis by tubed scales of the upper lateral
   line extending caudally into a line bisecting the lateral band blotches
   posterior to the mid-lateral spot. Krobia petitella n. sp. can be
   further diagnosed by the anterior lateral band spots lying immediately
   ventral to the upper lateral line, instead of being separated from the
   upper lateral line by a complete row of scales in all other species.
   Additionally, K. petitella n. sp. possesses a unique lateral coloration
   pattern formed by the combination of six vertical bars and four lateral
   band spots (vs. K. itanyi 5 bars/3 or 4 spots, K. guianensis 5/5, K.
   xinguensis 7/6, 'Aequidens' potaroensis 6/6, 'A'. paloemeuensis 5/5).
   The presence of Krobia petitella n. sp. in reaches of the Berbice River
   drainage in the Upper Demerara-Berbice region provides a novel locality
   for the genus in the Guianas and suggests the Berbice River has been
   isolated from the rest of nearby Guianese basins, particularly the
   Essequibo and the Corantijn.

AB Background: To date, the Lower Cretaceous Jehol Group of western
   Liaoning, China has yielded five monotypic genera of anurans, including
   Liaobatrachus grabaui, Callobatrachus sanyanensis, Mesophryne
   beipiaoensis, Dalianbatrachus mengi, and Yizhoubatrachus macilentus.
   However, the validity and distinctness of these taxa have been
   questioned. Methodology/Principal Finding: We provide a comprehensive
   analysis of the Jehol frogs that includes a re-examination of the
   published taxa as well as an examination of a number of new specimens
   that have been collected over the past 10 years. The results show that
   the five previously named taxa can be referred to three species of one
   genus-Liaobatrachus grabaui, L. beipiaoensis comb. nov. and L.
   macilentus comb. nov.. The diagnosis of Liaobatrachus is revised, and a
   new diagnosis is provided for each species of this genus. We also
   establish Liaobatrachus zhaoi sp. nov., on the basis of a dozen
   well-preserved specimens from a new locality. This taxon is
   distinguished by a unique combination of characteristics, including
   relatively long hind limbs, a rounded rather than triangular acetabulum,
   and a gradually-tapering cultriform process of the parasphenoid. In
   addition, an unnamed frog from a higher horizon, which has narrow sacral
   diapophyses and particularly long legs, is different from Liaobatrachus
   and represents another form of anuran in the Jehol Biota.
   Conclusion/Significance: Comparisons with other Mesozoic and extant
   anurans and the primary phylogenetic analysis both suggest that
   Liaobatrachus is a member of the anuran crown-group and forms a polytomy
   with leiopelmatids (Ascaphus and Leiopelma) and the remaining
   crown-group anurans (Lalagobatrachia).

AB We provide a thorough re-evaluation of the taxonomic diversity,
   phylogenetic relationships, and historical biogeography of the
   lambeosaurine hadrosaurids from the European Archipelago. Previously
   published occurrences of European Lambeosaurinae are reviewed and new
   specimens collected from upper Maastrichtian strata of the south-central
   Pyrenees are described. No support is found for the recognition of
   European saurolophines in the available hadrosaurid materials recovered
   so far from this area. A new genus and species of basal lambeosaurine,
   Canardia garonnensis, is described on the basis of cranial and
   appendicular elements collected from upper Maastrichtian strata of
   southern France. C. garonnensis differs from all other hadrosaurids,
   except Aralosaurus tuberiferus, in having maxilla with prominent
   subrectangular rostrodorsal flange; it differs from A. tuberiferus in a
   few maxillary and prefrontal characters. Together with A. tuberiferus,
   C. garonnensis integrates the newly recognized tribe Aralosaurini.
   Inference of lambeosaurine interrelationships via maximum parsimony
   analysis indicates that the other three known European lambeosaurines
   are representatives of two additional subclades (tribes) of these
   hadrosaurids: Tsintaosaurini (Pararhabdodon isonensis) and Lambeosaurini
   (the Arenysaurus ardevoli-Blasisaurus canudoi clade). The tribes
   Aralosaurini, Tsintaosaurini, Lambeosaurini, and Parasaurolophini are
   formally defined and diagnosed for the first time. Three event-based
   quantitative methods of ancestral range reconstruction were implemented
   to infer the historical biogeography of European lambeosaurines:
   Dispersal-Vicariance Analysis, Bayesian Binary MCMC, and
   Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis. The results of these analyses,
   coupled with the absence of pre-Maastrichtian lambeosaurines in the
   Mesozoic vertebrate fossil record of Europe, favor the hypothesis that
   aralosaurins and tsintaosaurins were Asian immigrants that reached the
   Ibero-Armorican island via dispersal events sometime during the
   Maastrichtian. Less conclusive is the biogeographical history of
   European lambeosaurins; several scenarios, occurring sometime during the
   Maastrichtian, are possible, from vicariance leading to the splitting of
   Asian or North American from European ranges to a dispersal event from
   North America to the European Archipelago.

   is characterised by a combination of short cephalic setae, large fovea
   amphidialis with 3 turns, short arcuate spicules without distal hook,
   and short tail with cylindrical proximal portion and blunt, rounded
   distal portion. Sabatieria parapraedatrix sp. n. is characterised by
   having a slender body, cuticle with striations resulting from fusion of
   every second lateral row of dots, fovea amphidialis with 2.0-2.5 turns,
   spicules with distal hook, and short conico-cylindrical tail. Sabatieria
   bubulba sp. n. is characterised by the presence of a large muscular
   pharyngeal bulb, secretory-excretory system with large ventral gland at
   level of intestine and with cuticularised pore opening. Sabatieria
   exculta sp. n. is characterised by having a slender body, cuticle with
   faint annulations resulting from fusion of every second or third lateral
   row of dots, short cephalic setae, a large ventral gland, and long,
   narrow gubernacular apophyses. Sabatieria balbutiens sp. n. is
   characterised by having a dorsally-directed mouth opening and
   assymetrical mouth cavity and spicules with small distal hook.
   Sabatieria pumila sp. n. is characterised by the combination of short
   body length, short cephalic setae, spicules with distal hook and short
   distal lamella, and 8-9 precloacal supplements. Sabatieria bathycopia
   sp. n. is characterised by having a stout body, short cephalic setae,
   curved gubernaculum, and spicules with swollen, lightly cuticularised
   distal tip.

   family Ethmolaimidae, subfamily Neotonchinae, based on specimens from
   two low-activity cold-seep environments at distant geographical
   locations. The new genus was first identified in samples from the Darwin
   mud volcano (1100 m depth) in the Gulf of Cadiz and later on also found
   in samples from a low-activity seep in the Larsen B embayment (820m
   depth) off the eastern Antarctic Peninsula. Until now, the family
   Ethmolaimidae contained nine genera: Ethmolaimus and Paraethmolaimus in
   the subfamily Ethmolaiminae, and Comesa, Filitonchoides, Filitonchus,
   Gomphionchus, Gomphionema, Nannolaimus, and Neothonchus in the subfamily
   Neotonchinae. The most important family characteristics are: an
   annulated cuticle bearing transverse rows of dots, cephalic sensilla
   arrangement of 6+6+4, a spiral amphid, an oesophagus with muscular
   posterior bulb, paired gonads and males with cup-shaped precloacal
   supplements. The new genus resembles Comesa and Neotonchus, but is
   typified by a ventrally displaced oral opening with three very small
   teeth that are easily overlooked. D. cadizensis gen. nov. sp. nov. is
   characterized by the 1401-2123 [mu]m long body; cuticle transversally
   striated with fine punctation; head conical; low lips; amphid spiralled
   3 turns, oral opening ventrally displaced, male with outstretched
   testes; spicules of equal size; gubernaculum plate-like and ten to
   twelve conspicuous cup-shaped precloacal supplements with external
   longitudinal articulated flange. D. brandtae gen. nov. sp. nov. can be
   distinguished by the 2438-3280 [mu]m long body; cuticle transversally
   striated with fine punctuation; head conical; low lips; amphid spiraled
   3+ turns; oral opening ventrally displaced; male with anterior testes
   outstretched and posterior one smaller and reflexed; spicules of equal
   size; gubernaculum plate-like and twenty conspicuous cup-shaped
   precloacal supplements with external longitudinal articulated flange.
   Notes on the ecology and habitat of the new genus are provided in light
   of its discovery in cold-seep environments.

AB Polycopids are one of the most diverse and often very abundant ostracod
   group in the deep sea. The true diversity of polycopids today inhabiting
   this environment, however, is very poorly known, because most of the
   studies identify ostracod material to the genus level, and they are
   based on the shell characters only. In this paper we describe
   Pseudopolycope (Pseudopolycope) andeep sp. nov. collected during the
   ANDEEP-SYSTCO I expedition in 2007 in the Atlantic Sector of the
   Southern Ocean. The new species was collected from 2,063 m depth. It
   differs from other 18 Recent Pseudopolycope Chavtur, 1981 species by (1)
   a peculiar morphology of the structures between claws on the uropodal
   lamellae; (2) morphology of the mandibular exopod; and (3) ornamentation
   of the shell. This is the first description of a living polycopid
   species from the deep Southern Ocean.

   uncertain width. The four traps were sunk in to a water tank which
   contained 16 adult and 11 small crabs for 20 minutes long. Within 20
   times experiments, the new designed traps caught 127 crabs while only 13
   crabs for the standard one. Furthermore, escape gaps test was done by

AB Background: The taxonomic status of the brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus
   sanguineus sensu stricto), which has long been regarded as the most
   widespread tick worldwide and a vector of many pathogens to dogs and
   humans, is currently under dispute. Methods: We conducted a
   comprehensive morphological and genetic study of 278 representative
   specimens, which belonged to different species (i.e., Rhipicephalus
   bursa, R. guilhoni, R. microplus, R. muhsamae, R. pusillus, R.
   sanguineus sensu lato, and R. turanicus) collected from Europe, Asia,
   Americas, and Oceania. After detailed morphological examination, ticks
   were molecularly processed for the analysis of partial mitochondrial
   (16S rDNA, 12S rDNA, and cox1) gene sequences. Results: In addition to
   R. sanguineus s.l. and R. turanicus, three different operational
   taxonomic units (namely, R. sp. I, R. sp. II, and R. sp. III) were found
   on dogs. These operational taxonomical units were morphologically and
   genetically different from R. sanguineus s.l. and R. turanicus. Ticks
   identified as R. sanguineus s.l., which corresponds to the so-called
   "tropical species" (= northern lineage), were found in all continents
   and genetically it represents a sister group of R. guilhoni. R.
   turanicus was found on a wide range of hosts in Italy and also on dogs
   in Greece. Conclusions: The tropical species and the temperate species
   (= southern lineage) are paraphyletic groups. The occurrence of R.
   turanicus in the Mediterranean region is confirmed. A consensual
   re-description of R. sanguineus s.s. and R. turanicus will be necessary
   to solve the taxonomic problems within the so-called R. sanguineus
   group.

   immature specimens collected from coastal sandy soil in Thailand
   (Phang-nga), Brazil (Sao Paulo) and the USA (Mississippi). Analysis
   shows that it is a member of Hypochthonioidea, but not of any named
   family, so the monobasic family Psammochthoniidae n. fam. is proposed.
   Traits that are unique among hypochthonioid mites include an adult body
   length under 250 [mu]m, a functionally trichoid body form (postpedal
   flexing), strong lateral displacement of setae in row e, which insert on
   a unique form of transverse scissure, subcapitular stenarthry, leg IV
   vestiges and a possible precocious genital swelling in the larva,
   apparent absence of an anal segment, and a highly regressed leg
   setation. The latter two, and some other traits that were previously
   unknown in Hypochthonioidea, suggest that Psammochthoniidae represents
   the first clearly paedomorphic lineage in this diverse superfamily. Like
   all other known hypochthonioid mites, P. kethleyi appears to be

AB The Sejoidea currently contains three families (Sejidae,
   Ichthyostomatogasteridae, Uropodellidae) of enigmatic mesostigmatic
   mites with a mixture of characters of general distribution in the
   Parasitiformes (e.g. hypertrichy, tarsus IV with an intercalary sclerite
   bearing a pair of ventral setae, archispermous mating system) and
   derived character states both unique (e.g. distinctive female
   sterno-gential region; first hypostomal setae adjacent and more or less
   membranous) and apparently convergent with other Mesostigmata (e.g.
   2-tined palpal apotele, reduced dorsal sclerotisation in the adult,
   phoretic deutonymph). In this paper, I review the characters defining
   the Sejoidea; propose a new genus, Reginacharlottia gen. nov. based on
   two new species: one from Lord Howe Island, New South Wales, Australia
   (R. lordhowensis sp. nov.) and one from Bahia State, Brazil (R.
   braziliensis sp. nov.) and erect a new family, Reginacharlottiidae fam.
   nov. to accommodate them. These new species share a number of unusual
   characters not otherwise known in the Sejida, including a plumose
   interdigital cheliceral excrescence, a highly reduced female genital
   shield, and a highly modified anal region covered by a pair of
   hypertrophied pre-anal setae; the postanal seta is absent. Adult female
   R. lordhowensis carry up to a dozen eggs that enclose fully developed
   larvae; the larvae also lack the postanal seta, but have a unique
   pygidial tubercle that may act as an egg burster. In addition, the
   female of Sejus americanus (Banks, 1902) is redescribed and the male
   described for the first time. Sejus species tend to be more typical of
   the warmer parts of the world, but S. americanus extends well into the
   boreal forest of Alberta, Canada (56[degree]N). A key to separate the
   families of Sejoidea is provided.

   [mu]m vs 27-30 [mu]m) rostellar hooks. The two species also differ in
   several other important characters such as relative length of the cirrus
   pouch, position of gonads and shape of mature proglottides.
   Morphological differentiation of the new species from all previously
   known Palearctic species of Staphylocystis from Sorex is also provided.
   Differentiation from Staphylocystis parasitic in crocidurine shrews is
   not provided due to the high level of specificity among shrew
   hymenolepidids to the host genera and much greater levels of sequence
   divergence between Staphylocystis from the two groups of shrews.
   Molecular differentiation based on 2,800 base pair long sequences of
   nuclear ribosomal RNA (complete ITS region and partial 28S region), 663
   base pair long sequences of mitochondrial nad1 gene and 542 base pair
   long sequences of mitochondrial ribosomal 16S gene strongly support the
   status of Staphylocystis clydesengeri n. sp. Relative utility of the DNA
   fragments used in this study for reliable differentiation among closely
   related species of mammalian hymenolepidids is discussed. Nuclear
   ribosomal RNA region appears to be too conserved for this purpose. Use
   of at least one mitochondrial gene in addition to nuclear ribosomal RNA
   or without it, is recommended. Vampirolepis novosibirskiensis Sawada &
   Kobayashi, 1994 is transferred to Staphylocystis as a junior synonym of
   S. furcata (Stieda, 1862). Rodentolepis gnoskei Greiman & Tkach, 2012 is
   transferred to Pararodentolepis Makarikov and Gulyaev, 2009 as a new
   combination Pararodentolepis gnoskei (Greiman & Tkach, 2012) n. comb.

AB Between November 2010 and January 2011, triploid Crassostrea gigas
   (Pacific oysters) cultivated in the Georges River, New South Wales,
   experienced >95% mortality. Mortalities also occurred in wild diploid C.
   gigas in the Georges River and shortly thereafter in the adjacent
   Parramatta River estuary upstream from Sydney Harbour. Neighbouring
   Saccostrea glomerata (Sydney rock oysters) did not experience
   mortalities in either estuary. Surviving oysters were collected to
   investigate the cause of mortalities. Histologically all oysters
   displayed significant pathology, and molecular testing revealed a high
   prevalence of ostreid herpesvirus-1 (OsHV-1). Quantitative PCR indicated
   that many C. gigas were carrying a high viral load at the time of
   sampling, while the load in S. glomerata was significantly lower
   (p<0.001). Subsequent in situ hybridisation experiments confirmed the
   presence of a herpesvirus in C. gigas but not S. glomerata tissues,
   suggesting that S. glomerata is not susceptible to infection with
   OsHV-1. Naive sentinel triploid C. gigas placed in the Georges River
   estuary in January 2011 quickly became infected and experienced nearly
   100% mortality within 2 wk of exposure, indicating the persistence of
   the virus in the environment. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences derived
   from the C2/C6 region of the virus revealed that the Australian strain
   of OsHV-1 belongs to the microvariant ([mu]-var) cluster, which has been
   associated with severe mortalities in C. gigas in other countries since
   2008. Environmental data revealed that the Woolooware Bay outbreaks
   occurred during a time of considerable environmental disturbance, with
   increased water temperatures, heavy rainfall, a toxic phytoplankton
   bloom and the presence of a pathogenic Vibrio sp. all potentially
   contributing to oyster stress. This is the first confirmed report of
   OsHV-1 [mu]-var related C. gigas mortalities in Australia.

AB Mammals dominate modern terrestrial herbivore ecosystems, whereas extant
   herbivorous reptiles are limited in diversity and body size. The
   evolution of reptile herbivory and its relationship to mammalian
   diversification is poorly understood with respect to climate and the
   roles of predation pressure and competition for food resources. Here, we
   describe a giant fossil acrodontan lizard recovered with a diverse
   mammal assemblage from the late middle Eocene Pondaung Formation of
   Myanmar, which provides a historical test of factors controlling body
   size in herbivorous squamates. We infer a predominately herbivorous
   feeding ecology for the new acrodontan based on dental anatomy,
   phylogenetic relationships and body size. Ranking body masses for
   Pondaung Formation vertebrates indicates that the lizard occupied a size
   niche among the larger herbivores and was larger than most carnivorous
   mammals. Paleotemperature estimates of Pondaung Formation environments
   based on the body size of the new lizard are approximately 2-5[degree]C
   higher than modern. These results indicate that competitive exclusion
   and predation by mammals did not restrict body size evolution in these
   herbivorous squamates, and elevated temperatures relative to modern
   climates during the Paleogene greenhouse may have resulted in the
   evolution of gigantism through elevated poikilothermic metabolic rates
   and in response to increases in floral productivity.

   cuticle. The worm grows by adding more sclerites to each annulus. The
   spacing of plates in the same row gets looser. The new microplates and

   specimens from the San Alejandro River, a tributary of the upper Ucayali
   River in central Peru. Panaqolus albivermis is diagnosed from all other
   Panaqolus except P. maccus by having head, body, and fins with widely
   separated small white to yellow spots, vermiculations, and/or thin
   oblique bands on a black base (vs. exclusively small white to yellow
   spots on a black base in P. albomaculatus, generally broad oblique bands
   of alternating light to dark brown in P. changae, P. gnomus, P.
   purusiensis, and a uniformly dark gray to black body color in P. dentex,
   P. koko, and P. nocturnus); P. albivermis can be diagnosed from P.
   maccus by having a black base color (vs. brown), by having parallel
   dentary tooth cups (vs. acute intermandibular tooth cup angle), and by
   having a larger known adult body size (95.8 mm SL vs. 84.8).

AB The Afrotropical sac spider genus Messapus Simon, 1898, presently placed
   in the Castianeirinae, is reviewed. The type material of the type
   species, M. martini Simon, 1898, clearly represents two different
   species, a corinnine female (here designated the lectotype) and a
   castianeirine male (the paralectotype). The female is redescribed and
   its corresponding male is described for the first time. As a result,
   Messapus is transferred to the Corinninae. Corinna natalis Pocock, 1898
   is transferred to Messapus, while Messapus secundus Strand, 1907 is
   transferred to Merenius Simon, 1909. The new genus Copuetta gen. nov.,
   with the type species C. maputa sp. nov., is established to accommodate
   the misidentified castianeirine male paralectotype of M. martini, and
   its matching female is described for the first time. Castianeira
   kibonotensis Lessert, 1921 syn. nov. is considered a junior synonym of
   Copuetta lacustris (Strand, 1916) comb. nov., which is redescribed from
   both sexes and transferred from Copa Simon, 1885. A further eleven new
   species of Copuetta are described: C. comorica sp. nov., C. erecta sp.
   nov., C. kakamega sp. nov., C. kwamgumi sp. nov., C. lesnei sp. nov., C.
   litipo sp. nov., C. lotzi sp. nov., C. magna sp. nov., C. naja sp. nov.,
   C. uzungwa sp. nov. and C. wagneri sp. nov. Of these species, only C.
   lacustris and C. magna sp. nov. have large distribution ranges. Seven of
   the species are only known from the type locality and the remaining four
   have distributions restricted to one or two countries. A second new
   genus, Wasaka gen. nov., is described for four new species with
   restricted distributions from East and Central Africa: W. imitatrix sp.
   nov., W. montana sp. nov., W. occulta sp. nov. (type species) and W.
   ventralis sp. nov. A first phylogenetic analysis focused on the
   Afrotropical Castianeirinae is presented. The results support the
   placement and transfer of Messapus (including M. natalis comb. nov.) and
   Medmassa Simon, 1887 in the Corinninae, and the monophyly of a clade
   including the four cryptic lycosiform castianeirine genera from the
   Afrotropical Region (Copa, Copuetta gen. nov., Echinax
   Deeleman-Reinhold, 2001 and Wasaka gen. nov.). The implications of the
   phylogenetic results are briefly discussed.

   longus Yang & Yang, H. particularis Yang, Yang & Hu, H. serratus Yang &
   Yang, H. xishuangbannaensis Yang & Yang, and H. zhejiangensis Yang &
   Yang. Eight informal species-groups are tentatively proposed based on
   characters of male and female terminalia and attention is drawn to the
   many previously overlooked taxonomically useful characters of the female
   terminalia. Distribution maps of all species are presented and
   distributions categorised as 'widespread', 'eastern', 'southern',
   north-eastern' or 'northern and western'. Species richness and
   endemicity are greatest in mid to high elevation evergreen forest
   biotopes of the northern mountains and areas of endemism are identified
   on the Luang Prabang, Daen Lao, Thanon Thongchai ranges and on the Isaan
   Plateau at least. Adult phenology is correlated with the rainy season in
   many species and preliminary analyses reveal that many high-elevation
   species have short emergence periods and restricted distributions,
   whereas some lowland species have longer emergence periods and wider
   distributions.

   relative to standard length (30.5 % vs. 26.8% in P. burchelli and 25.8%

AB For nearly 40 years Bolitoglossa paraensis has been synonymized with
   Bolitoglossa altamazonica. This fact has been mainly related to
   taxonomic ambiguities arising from the morphological similarities
   between these species and the scarcity of material deposited in
   collections. However, during the past 30 years new material of
   Bolitoglossa has been collected in many places throughout the Brazilian
   Amazonia, including the type locality of B. paraensis, Santa Isabel do
   Para. In this article we designate the neotype of B. paraensis based on
   new material from the type locality, correct misinterpretations about
   this name. We determined how many species of the genus Bolitoglossa
   occur in Brazilian Amazonia, described three new species, B. caldwellae
   sp. nov., B. madeira sp. nov., and B. tapajonica sp. nov., provide a key
   for identifying Brazilian salamanders. Were analyzed two hundred and
   seventy eight specimens of Bolitoglossa from the Brazilian states of
   Acre, Amapa, Amazonas, Para, and Rondonia; morphological data of B.
   altamazonica from Colombia were used for comparison purposes. We confirm
   the presence of B. altamazonica in extreme western Brazil, and expand
   the number of species occurring in Brazilian Amazonia to five.

   current locality, in Arunachal Pradesh, Northeast India. However, it
   differs substantially in pelage colour, most particularly on the ventral
   surfaces of the body, patagia, tail membrane, and tail. The single
   specimen was found in an area of central Lao PDR, which is characterised

   the Lao limestone rat (Saxatilomys paulinae).

AB The present study was designed to measure the oxygen consumption,

   osmoregulatory ability of cuttlefish Sepiella maindroni, an important
   cultured species of China, at different temperatures. Juvenile
   cuttlefish were exposed to temperatures of 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32
   [degree]C for 10 days, respectively. Oxygen consumption (R) rates
   increased significantly from 16 to 28 [degree]C and then, slightly
   decreased at 32 [degree]C (P < 0.05). Ammonia excretion (U) rates
   increased with increasing temperature. The highest R Q10 and U Q10
   values occurred within 16 and 20 [degree]C, and the intermediate R Q10
   and U Q10 values were found within 24 and 28 [degree]C. The calculated R
   Q10 dropped to minimum values within 28 and 32 [degree]C which suggested
   that treated groups with temperature of 32 [degree]C were under a
   stressful situation. The suffocation point (SP) and SP/SD (suffocation
   duration) increased significantly with increasing temperature, and
   peaked at 28 [degree]C, then dropped to the minimum level at 32
   [degree]C. The SD decreased significantly with increasing temperature.
   The hemolymph total protein concentration decreased significantly from
   16 to 24 [degree]C and then increased significantly, reaching a maximum
   at 32 [degree]C. Hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was
   significantly low at 32 [degree]C than that of at other temperatures.
   The lowest and highest branchial Na+, K+-ATPase activity, and Na+ and
   Cl- contents occurred at 24 and 28 [degree]C, respectively. The present
   results indicate that temperature can modify certain physiological
   parameters and by enhancing oxygen utilization, optimal temperatures
   significantly contribute to higher growth rates. It is suggested that
   the protein increase in the hemoglobin below and above 24 [degree]C,
   will lead to an increase of energy expenditure from protein as an
   adjustment to temperature changes. Moreover, extremely high temperatures
   may result in adverse effects on juvenile S. maindroni that are related
   to ammonia-N and oxidative stress. [copyright] 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Background: Secondary adaptation to aquatic life occurred independently
   in several amniote lineages, including reptiles during the Mesozoic and
   mammals during the Cenozoic. These evolutionary shifts to aquatic
   environments imply major morphological modifications, especially of the
   feeding apparatus. Mesozoic (250-65 Myr) marine reptiles, such as
   ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, mosasaurid squamates, crocodiles, and
   turtles, exhibit a wide range of adaptations to aquatic feeding and a
   broad overlap of their tooth morphospaces with those of Cenozoic marine
   mammals. However, despite these multiple feeding behavior convergences,
   suction feeding, though being a common feeding strategy in aquatic
   vertebrates and in marine mammals in particular, has been extremely
   rarely reported for Mesozoic marine reptiles. Principal Findings: A
   relative of fossil protostegid and dermochelyoid sea turtles,
   Ocepechelon bouyai gen. et sp. nov. is a new giant chelonioid from the
   Late Maastrichtian (67 Myr) of Morocco exhibiting remarkable adaptations
   to marine life (among others, very dorsally and posteriorly located
   nostrils). The 70-cm-long skull of Ocepechelon not only makes it one of
   the largest marine turtles ever described, but also deviates
   significantly from typical turtle cranial morphology. It shares unique
   convergences with both syngnathid fishes (unique long tubular bony snout
   ending in a rounded and anteriorly directed mouth) and beaked whales
   (large size and elongated edentulous jaws). This striking anatomy
   suggests extreme adaptation for suction feeding unmatched among known
   turtles. Conclusion/Significance: The feeding apparatus of Ocepechelon,
   a bony pipette-like snout, is unique among tetrapods. This new taxon
   exemplifies the successful systematic and ecological diversification of
   chelonioid turtles during the Late Cretaceous. This new evidence for a
   unique trophic specialization in turtles, along with the abundant marine
   vertebrate faunas associated to Ocepechelon in the Late Maastrichtian
   phosphatic beds of Morocco, further supports the hypothesis that marine
   life was, at least locally, very diversified just prior to the
   Cretaceous/Palaeogene (K/Pg) biotic crisis.

   of the Dahomey gap. Another species confused with Boulengeria
   melanoleuca, namely B. adelynhoserae sp. nov. from South Africa and
   immediately adjacent areas, is also formally described according to the

AB The so-called Burrowing Asps or Mole Vipers, Atractaspididae Gunther,
   1858 are endemic to Africa and the Middle-east. As of early 2012, all
   were placed within a single genus Atractaspis Smith, 1849. However Hoser
   (2012b) used morphological and molecular data to remove species with
   smaller dorsal scales and a divergent venom apparatus (microlepidota and
   andersoni) from the genus and place them into a new genus Hoseraspea,
   Hoser, 2012. The genus Atractaspis as defined as of start 2013 consists
   of about 20 recognized species, including quite morphologically diverse
   forms. This paper now removes other divergent species from Atractaspis,
   based on both molecular and morphological evidence, placing them into
   the genus Georgekonstandinouous gen. nov. in turn placed in a new tribe
   Georgekonstandinouiini tribe nov., being within the family
   Homoroselapidae Hoser, 2012, thereby necessitating a redefinition of the
   family Homoroselapidae and tribe Homoroselapiini Hoser, 2012 (Hoser,
   2012a), as well as refinement to the diagnosis for the family
   Atractaspididae. Georgekonstandinouous gen. nov. is further divided in
   three, with the creation of the subgenera Slatteryaspus subgen. nov. and
   Wellingtonaspus subgen. nov. The species Atractaspis boulengeri
   Mocquard, 1897, is divergent relative to the remaining species within
   the genus, both morphologically and based on molecular studies. As a
   result it is placed in a new subgenus Benjaminswileus subgen. nov.. The
   divergent species A. duerdeni Gough, 1907 is also placed in a monotypic
   subgenus Lowryus subgen. nov.. All new taxon groups are defined
   according to the Zoological Code (Ride et al. 1999). The species A.
   engaddensis Haas, 1950; A. fallax Peters, 1867; A. magrettii Scortecci,
   1928; A. phillipsi Barbour, 1913; A. watsoni Boulenger, 1908 are
   transferred to Hoseraspea Hoser, 2012. While as a result of the actions
   within this paper about 10 species remain within Atractaspis Smith,
   1849, further investigations may lead to a further re-arrangement of the
   genus in the future both in terms of generic placement of existing
   species and also potential recognition and/or descriptions of similar
   species.

   strong morphological and biological differences between members. As a
   result, in Liopeltis, what is perhaps the most divergent species is

   2012, Dendrelaphis Boulenger, 1890, Chrysopelea Boie, 1826 and Ahaetulla

   subject of numerous taxonomic and phylogenetic studies, notably
   including those of Coventry and Rawlinson (1980) and Keogh et al.
   (2000). These studies have resulted in both species and generic
   rearrangements. Coventry and Rawlinson (1980) synonymised described taxa
   to reduce the genus to four well-defined species. Keogh et al. (2000)
   transferred the species coronata Schlegel, 1837 to the genus
   Elapognathus Boulenger, 1896. Revisiting the taxonomy of the four
   species placed by most authors prior to 2000 in the genus Drysdalia, the
   data shows that the following taxonomic actions are warranted. The
   species coronata should in fact be placed within a subgenus of
   Elapognathus, due to a well-defined divergence from the nominate species
   in the genus. Likewise for the species rhodogaster Jan, 1873, which is
   appropriately placed in a subgenus within Drysdalia. Furthermore, the
   species mastersii Krefft, 1866 has long been recognized as having three
   morphologically distinct regional forms (Ehmann 1992). Molecular
   analysis (Dubey et al. 2010) confirms that these snakes warrant
   taxonomic recognition at the subspecies level. As a result, this paper
   formally describes and names two new subgenera and two new subspecies in

   is split three ways, with one population named as a new species Bitis
   (Calechidna) matteoae sp. nov. and the taxon B. atropos unicolor
   Fitzimons, 1959 elevated to full species status for the third group.
   Within the new subgenus Klosevipera subgen. nov., the species B.
   caudalis (Smith, 1839) is divided into three, with the variant from
   Transvaal, Limpopo and nearby parts of South Africa formally named as
   Bitis (Klosevipera) caudalis swileae subsp. nov. and the variant from
   the coastal strip of Namibia formally named as Bitis (Klosevipera)
   caudalis kajerikbulliardi subsp. nov.. The Puff Adder, Bitis arietans
   (Merrem, 1820), as currently recognized is a widespread True Viper from
   Africa, found in most parts of the continent, except for wettest and
   driest parts, as well as the lower Arabian Peninsula. While the type
   specimen population from South Africa and a regional form from Somalia
   have taxonomic recognition the other regional forms do not. This paper
   defines and describes five other regional variants, in effect meaning
   that Bitis arietans (Merrem, 1820) as commonly known to date has been
   formally divided into seven regionally allopatric species. The species
   Bitis parviocula Bohme, 1977, divergent from others within Macrocerastes
   is placed in its own monotypic subgenus Kuekus subgen. nov.. The other
   species within Macrocerastes are reviewed in a separate paper (Hoser
   2013b), the result being four new taxa formally named.

AB The Gaboon Viper Bitis gabonica (Dumeril, Bibron and Dumeril, 1854) as a
   species complex has had a fairly stable taxonomic history since being
   described at the species level, although the species as generally
   recognized was transferred to the genus Bitis Gray, 1842 shortly after
   the original description. Likewise for the Nose-horned Viper species
   complex Bitis (Macrocerastes) nasicornis (Shaw, 1802). The species known
   as the Rhinoceros Viper Bitis rhinoceros (Schlegel, 1855) was
   synonymised with Bitis gabonica by virtually all herpetologists beyond
   1855 until 1999 (see McDiarmid et al. 1999), when Lenk et al. (1999)
   provided a molecular basis to recognize the western population, (then
   known as Bitis gabonica rhinoceros) identified in 1999 on the basis of
   allopatric distribution as opposed to any consistent morphological
   divergence. Chippaux (2006), showed that consistent differences in the
   markings on the side of the head could be used to identify and separate
   Bitis rhinoceros from the nominate species. Meanwhile the Gaboon Viper
   as popularly recognized since 1999 comprises the main population centred
   on the wetter parts of west-central Africa (the type locality Gabon)
   including several countries and then three quite distant and unconnected
   outlier populations. These are each centred on eastern Tanzania along
   the coastal strip and hills nearby, the eastern escarpments of Zimbabwe
   and KwaZulu-Natal, north-east South Africa. Like the disjunct West
   African population now identified as B. rhinoceros, specimens within the
   three other outlier populations also have consistent phenotypic
   differences to the main group making them worthy of taxonomic
   recognition. As all have been reproductively isolated for a long time
   and clearly form evolutionary species units, each are formally described
   herein as new species and named according to the Zoological Code. The
   species known as the Bitis (Macrocerastes) nasicornis (Shaw, 1802), has
   had a stable taxonomic history at the species level. However phenotypic
   differences between the nominate western form and that from east of the
   Dahomey Gap are well known (Phelps 2010), but have not been properly and
   consistently identified. As they have been reproductively isolated for a
   long time and clearly form evolutionary species units, the eastern form
   is described and named according to the Zoological Code.

   and A. tubitheca, are new. Previously unreported data on the nematocyst
   complement of Heterocoryne caribbensis Wedler & Larson, 1986, Ectopleura

   Ritchie, 1909 in the Caribbean is questioned upon comparison of its
   cnidome with that of specimens from Tristan da Cunha, the type locality
   of this species. An unexpectedly wide morphological variation is noted
   for Aglaophenia rhynchocarpa Allman, 1877. Specimens corresponding to
   the Caribbean Gymnangium longicaudum (Nutting, 1900), are shown to be
   indistinguishable morphologically from a taxon described earlier from

   ecosystem in the Gulf of Mexico. The samples come from 20 soft bottom
   stations in the Terminos Lagoon during the dry and rainy seasons, of
   which eight included paraonids. In all, 1183 specimens belonging to two
   new species were identified: Aricidea (Acmira) hirsuta (1125 specimens)
   and Paradoneis carmelitensis (58 specimens). A. (A.) hirsuta is clearly
   distinguished from other members of the genus by the presence of
   unidentate curved spines with a dense pubescence along their medium and
   distal margins, and because the median antenna is short. P.
   carmelitensis is mainly characterized by the absence of eyes, by the
   presence of triangular shaped postchaetal prebranchial lobes, and the
   presence of branchiae and lyriform chaetae from chaetiger 4. The
   paraonids occurrence was mainly associated with salinities close to
   marine conditions (31.71 to 35.85 psu). They were almost totally
   collected during the rainy season (1178 specimens from both species) in
   the central and southern areas; during the dry season only five
   specimens of P. carmelitensis were recorded.

   long been recognized as being paraphyletic, with various species groups
   having been assigned generic names in the past. Notwithstanding this
   fact, most publishing authors continue to group all within Atractus as a
   matter of convenience rather than an evidence-based firm belief that all
   should be placed within a single genus on the basis of accepted genus
   level affinity. This paper begins the dismemberment of the genus
   Atractus as known to date and formally removes three divergent species

   B. asper (Garman, 1884) has long been known to be composite. For the
   first time, this paper gives formal taxonomic recognition to three
   regional forms. The population from the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica,
   long known to be distinct from the nominal form of B. xanthogrammus is
   accorded full species status, described herein as B. lenhoseri sp. nov..
   The population from Nuclear Central America, mainly near the Atlantic
   Coast, being the region generally north from Nicaragua to southern
   Mexico, including the lowland zone adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico and
   the border with Guatemala and Belize is herein described as B.
   mexicoiensis sp. nov. The population of snakes north of Mexico City in
   the area of San Luis de Potosi, Mexico is in turn formally named as a
   subspecies of B. mexicoiensis sp. nov., namely B. mexicoiensis
   maccartneyi subsp. nov.. All are defined according to the Zoological
   Code (Ride et al. 1999) on the basis of consistent colouration and
   scalation differences between these forms and the nominal form of B.
   asper, herein restricted to the region generally south of Nicaragua,
   including the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica and including the north of
   South America.

TI A review and rearrangement of Pitviper genera (Serpentes: Viperidae:

AB The generic arrangement of the Vipers has been subject of considerable
   change in recent years. The majority of reviews in the period 1990-2013
   have tended to divide formerly large genera along phylogenetic lines.
   Most recently erected genera have had widespread acceptance within the
   herpetological community. A review of the Viperidae has shown
   inconsistent treatment of species groups, with some accorded recognition
   at the genus level, while others of similar divergence remain subsumed
   within larger paraphyletic genera. In order to make the treatment of
   Viper species at the genus level consistent, a review was undertaken
   including checking all relevant published literature, descriptions and
   phylogenies as well as direct inspection of specimens, including live,
   photos and museum specimens. As a result of earlier published papers by
   myself (including a paper published simultaneously to this one) (Hoser
   2013c) and papers by others, the taxonomy and nomenclature of the True
   Vipers (Viperinae) appears to be consistent, based on this review.
   However, within the Pitvipers a very different picture emerged with
   several groups (clades) requiring formal taxonomic recognition at the
   genus or subgenus level. This was most notably the case for the deeply
   divergent and morphologically convergent Asian taxa. As a result, these
   unnamed groups are formally described for the first time, according to
   the Zoological Code (Ride et al. 1999). All groups are named on the
   basis of robust morphological and molecular data (refer to Hoser 2013b)
   and as identified in this paper. These are 8 newly named genera and 8
   newly named subgenera. At the subfamily level, two morphologically
   divergent Tribes, namely Calloselasmiini Hoser, 2013 (Hoser 2013a) and
   Tropidolaemusini Hoser, 2012 are each placed in newly defined
   subfamilies on the basis of recent phylogenetic studies and published
   results which shows their continued placement within Crotalinae to be
   problematic. An updated list of Viper subfamilies, tribes and genera is
   presented.

   species of the same subgenus. Morphological data from worker, queen and
   male ants, as well as genetic data from three nuclear genes (long
   wavelength rhodopsin, arginine kinase and carbomoylphosphate synthase)
   and one mitochondrial marker (cytochrome oxidase I) led to the
   recognition of six species. Within the C. kelleri-group, three new
   species are described: C. hazolava Blaimer sp. n., C. hafahafa Blaimer
   sp. n. and C. tavaratra Blaimer sp. n. The previously described taxa C.
   kelleri Forel and C. madagascariensis Andre are validated by our
   analysis. Conversely, our data suggests synonymy of C. adrepens Forel
   (with C. kelleri) and C. gibba Emery (with C. madagascariensis). A more
   distantly related and phylogenetically isolated species, C. tsisitsilo
   Blaimer sp. n., is further described. We report high levels of
   morphological and molecular variation in C. kelleri and illustrate that
   this variation can be explained partly by geography. Species
   descriptions, images, distribution maps and identification keys based on
   worker ants, as well as on queen and male ants where available, are
   presented for all six species. Our work highlights the elevated species
   richness of Crematogaster ants throughout Madagascar's humid forests,

   multiple data sources to ensure clear demarcation of this diversity.

AB In the mesozooplanktonic community of the coastal upwelling system of
   the Ria de Vigo (NW Spain), the euphausiid Nyctiphanes couchii has been
   identified for the first time in temperate waters of the NE Atlantic as
   the intermediate host for cystacanths of Rhadinorhynchus sp. Parasites
   were identified using morphological characters described in 20
   cystacanths. The hooks of the proboscis were arranged in 14 rows of 26
   hooks each, while the hooks of the basal circle were only slightly
   erected and were longer than remaining spines. A maximum-likelihood
   estimation (ML) tree inferred from the 18S rRNA data set of
   Palaeacantocephala revealed that our specimens belong to a highly
   supported clade with Rhadinorhynchus sp., Pararhadinorhynchus sp. and
   Transvena annulospinosa. Nonetheless, our morphological and phylogenetic
   analyses suggested that the status of Rhadinorhynchus pristis should be
   re-examined. The prevalences of parasites were 0.0019% and 0.0001% for
   frontal and coastal summer communities, and 0.0068% and 0.0008% for
   coastal and oceanic autumn communities, respectively. The presence of
   these cystacanths in different mesozooplankton communities throughout
   the study suggests that the recruitment of parasites may be affected by
   the oceanography.

AB A first comprehensive phylogeny of the entire family Curtonotidae is
   generated from molecular markers and morphology. The molecular data set
   comprises 33 taxa (30 in-group Curtonotidae; three out-groups: Camilla,
   Diastata, Drosophila) and 4 gene regions from 3 genes: 2 non-contiguous
   fragments from the CPSase (carbamoylphosphate synthetase) domain of the
   nuclear protein coding gene CAD (= CAD1 and CAD3); a fragment from the
   coding region of TPI (triosephosophate isomerase); and a fragment of the
   mitochondrial gene CO1 (cytochrome oxidase 1). We performed Bayesian
   likelihood analyses in the program MrBayes 3.2; maximum likelihood
   analyses in the program Garli 2.0; and parsimony analysis in TNT on the
   concatenated genetic dataset. A data matrix of 62 discrete,
   morphological features of imagines was compiled from 75 taxa (70
   in-group Curtonotidae taxa and five out-group exemplars: Amiota,
   Camilla, Diastata, Drosophila, Stegana), and these data are presented as
   Appendix II. For the combined morphological and molecular data a
   Bayesian likelihood analysis in the program MrBayes 3.2 and a parsimony
   analysis in TNT were performed, and for the morphological dataset a
   parsimony analysis was carried out in TNT. Results of the molecular and
   morphological analyses attest to the monophyly of the Curtonotidae and
   clearly indicate two primary clades, with Axinota + Curtonotum being
   sister to the remainder of the Curtonotidae. Curtonotum sensu stricto
   (sensu Klymko and Marshall 2011) is here adopted and ten newly-defined
   species-groups of the genus Curtonotum are recognised the: anus; boeny;
   campsiphallum; gonzo; platyphallum; rinhatinana; saheliense;
   striatifrons; stuckenbergi; and uncinatum species-groups. The following
   nomenclatorial changes are proposed: Cyrtona appendiculata Seguy, 1938
   is formally re-instated as a valid species and is removed as a junior
   synonym of Cyrtona pictipennis (Thomson, 1869). The former variety name
   sublineata (Duda, 1939) is upgraded to a specific name, as Parapsinota
   sublineata (Duda, 1939). The continental Afrotropical fauna of the genus
   Curtonotum Macquart, 1844 is revised and a diagnosis of the genus is
   provided. Known biology, behaviour and published information on immature
   stages of the genus are briefly reviewed. Type material of 12 of the 13
   named species (C. angolense Tsacas, C. campsiphallum Tsacas, C.
   cuthbertsoni Duda, C. herrero Tsacas, C. pauliani Tsacas, C.

   sao Tsacas, C. simile Tsacas, C. striatifrons Malloch and C. tigrinum
   Seguy), was studied and errors in previous interpretations and
   designation of type specimens are resolved. Curtonotum pauliani is the
   only species occurring on both the continental African mainland and
   Madagascar. The type specimen of C. maculiventris (Enderlein) is lost
   and a neotype is here designated. One species synonymy is proposed: C.
   tigrinum Seguy, 1933 = C. maculiventris (Enderlein, 1917), syn. n.
   Additional material of the aforementioned species is noted,
   substantially increasing their known distributions. Thirteen species are

   are more similar to crown fleas than other stem fleas in having a
   relatively small body size, relatively short and slender
   piercing-sucking stylet mouthparts, comparably short and compact
   antennae, rows of short and stiff bristles on the thorax, and highly
   elongated legs. The new finding greatly improves our understanding of
   the morphological transition to the highly specialized body plan of
   extant fleas. However, saurophthirids also display several features
   unknown in other fleas, and some of these features are suggestive of a
   possible ectoparasitic relationship to contemporaneous pterosaurs,
   though other possibilities exist. The new fossils, in conjunction with
   previous discoveries, highlight a broad diversity of ectoparasitic
   insects in the mid-Mesozoic.

AB A new lithostrotian sauropod, the small-sized Overosaurus paradasorum n.
   gen et sp. from the Anacleto Formation (Campanian, Late Cretaceous,
   Neuquen Group, Patagonia, Argentina) is here described. The specimen
   (MAU-Pv-CO-439) consists of a fully articulated vertebral series from
   the 10th cervical to the 20th caudal vertebra, the last cervical ribs,
   several dorsal ribs in articulation with their respective vertebrae, the
   complete right ilium and fragments of the left ilium. Overosaurus
   paradasorum is diagnosed by a unique combination of characters that
   includes (1) posterior cervical vertebrae with long pre-and
   postzygapophyses that project beyond the anterior and posterior borders
   of the centrum, respectively, (2) postspinal lamina absent in all dorsal
   neural spines, (3) wide and massive 9th and 10th caudal centra that are
   slightly excavated laterally and have relatively flat ventral surfaces,
   (4) laminar projection on the posterior border of the second and third
   dorsal rib, (5) ilium proportionally shorter anteroposteriorly and
   taller dorsoventrally than in other lithostrotians, and (6) the
   preacetabular process of the ilium strongly deflected laterally and with
   a ventrolaterally tapering end. Analysis of the phylogenetic
   relationships of Overosaurus places it within the Aeolosaurini, as the
   sister taxon of a monophyletic group formed by Aeolosaurus rionegrinus,
   A. maximus, Gondwanatitan faustoi and Pitekunsaurus macayai. Overosaurus
   is a new representative of a highly diversified assemblage of Campanian
   lithostrotians from Patagonia that includes both Aeolosaurini and
   saltasaurids (e.g. Saltasaurus, Neuquensaurus)-this small new taxon
   falls within the low end of the size spectrum represented by these Late
   Cretaceous sauropods.

AB A small, new species of gerbil rodents of the genus Eligmodontia from
   the southwestern dunes of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile is
   described; the genus had not been reported for this western lowland
   region. Our description is based on cytogenetic and molecular data, as
   well as cranial and external morphology. In order to support this
   hypothesis, we studied 27 specimens captured in Playa Los Choros
   (Coquimbo) and Copiapo (Atacama), comparing them with samples of all the
   extant species of the genus. Nineteen individuals consistently showed
   2N= 50, FN= 48, with telocentric chromosomes and G-bands identical to
   those of the geographically northeastern E. hirtipes; these two groups
   were geographically separated by E. puerulus (2N= 34, FN= 48). The
   phylogenetic analysis of 56 Eligmodontia cytochrome-b gene sequences
   yielded a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree where the new species
   formed a divergent and well-supported clade within the genus, which was
   also confirmed by unweighted parsimony, minimum evolution, and Bayesian
   analyses. The new species has K2P genetic distances of 12.8% from the
   geographically distant E. hirtipes, and 10.3% from E. puerulus. Axes 1
   and 2 of Principal Component Analysis based on 12 body and skull
   measurements clearly separated the new species, the latter having a
   smaller head+ body length (70.6[plus or minus]3.4 mm, n= 17) and lower
   weight (11.9[plus or minus]1.9 g, n= 20). We provide strong evidence to
   recognize a distinct new western lineage within Eligmodontia genus,
   Eligmodontia dunaris sp. nov., for which we give a complete taxonomic
   description and a hypothetical biogeographic scenario. The new species
   should be considered endangered, due to its level of endemism, its low
   population numbers (which can be occasionally increased after a blooming
   desert) and its fragile dry habitat patchily distributed near the
   Atacama Desert.

AB The ichnospecies Cladichnus parallelum consists of upper components
   characterized by downward branching, decreasingly inclined tubes, and
   lower components having horizontal, long, parallel tubes formed in the
   laminated part of a muddy, marly turbidite. The tubes of both components
   were successively produced, and the lower ones display an annulated
   fill. The producers of Cladichnus exhibit thigmotactic and phobotactic
   behavior in that the tubes are regularly spaced apart, do not cross
   over- or cross-cut, and their orientation is related to the fabric of
   the turbidite. The tube fill of both components is enriched in
   terrigenous material and organic matter suggesting selective feeding on
   the sediment surface, and the tubes do not show any grain sorting around
   them. The strong compression of the horizontal tubes suggests that the
   fill initially had high porosity. The producer of Cladichnus parallelum
   probably took advantage of burrowing in an anoxic setting; microbes
   likely played a role in converting organic material stored within the
   tubes or in processing dissolved compounds drained into the highly
   porous tubes.

AB As a result of several field trips and studies of collections of
   Phymaturus samples from Andean areas of central western Argentina (San
   Juan province), we discovered two populations that exhibit a particular
   character combination not seen in other species formally recognized in
   the literature. Based on a detailed analysis of an extended list of
   morphological characters (93), including scalation, color pattern, gular
   and nuchal folds, precloacal pores, and morphometric data, we conclude
   that these populations represent independent lineages that deserve to be
   considered as new species. According to the most recent revision of the
   genus and considering the descriptions made in another recent
   contribution, the taxonomic composition of the genus was increased to 38
   species. In this study we provide the formal description of two
   additional new taxa, including their diagnosis and detailed comparisons
   with other members of their species group. The two new species belong to
   the palluma group, and can be assigned to the Puna subclade because they
   present the typical dorsal "spray" pattern. Other characters described
   in this study suggest their close phylogenetic relationship with other
   species of this subclade inhabiting the southern Puna region of
   Argentina, such as Phymaturus punae. Within the Puna subclade,
   Phymaturus aguanegra sp. nov. differs from all other members (P.
   antofagastensis, P. denotatus, P. laurenti, P. punae, P. extrilidus, P.
   mallimaccii and P. paihuanense) exhibiting the following combination of
   diagnostic characters: a complete melanism over the dorsum of neck, the
   presence of enlarged scales at the base of tail in males, having
   strongly keeled tarsal scales, lacking enlarged scales on the anterior
   margin of the antehumeral fold and centre of chest, females without
   flank coloration, a vertebral dark gray stripe usually present on the
   dorsum, females exhibiting a tricolor dorsal pattern, with two types of
   brown and scattered ferriferous oxide spots, and the absence of a
   scapular spot. Phymaturus williamsi sp. nov. differs from all other
   members of the Puna clade because: exhibits an "aggregate" dorsal
   pattern, unlike the homogeneous spray of most Puna species, lacks
   enlarged scales on the anterior margin of the antehumeral fold and in
   the centre of chest, flank coloration in females is absent, females of
   Phymaturus williamsi sp. nov. lack white transversal stripes on the
   dorsal pattern, preocular scale in contact with canthal scale in
   Phymaturus williamsi sp. nov., rostral scale can be divided in
   Phymaturus williamsi sp. nov. and shows the largest number of scales
   counted around midbody within the Puna subclade (x= 213.4; 186-235).

AB Hypotheses on the age and possible antiquity of the modern deep-sea
   fauna put forward to date almost all agree on the assumption that the
   deep-sea fauna is largely the result of colonisation from shallow-water
   environments. Here, the fossil record of the Ophiacanthidae, a modern
   deep-sea brittle star family with extensive fossil occurrences at shelf
   depths, is systematically traced against a calibrated phylogeny. Several
   lines of evidence suggest that the Ophiacanthidae originated and greatly
   diversified in the deep sea, with most extant clades having diverged by
   the end of the Triassic at the latest. During the Jurassic, the family
   temporarily invaded shelf environments, attaining relative abundances
   and diversities comparable to those found in coeval and modern deep-sea
   settings, and gradually declined in abundance subsequently, to become
   largely restricted to the deep-sea again. The pattern of temporary
   expansion to shelf environments suggested here underpins the potential
   of deep-sea environments to contribute significantly to shallow-water
   biodiversity; an aspect that has mostly been neglected so far. It is
   speculated that the large-scale ophiacanthid invasion of shelf
   environments around the Triassic-Jurassic boundary was initiated by a
   change from thermohaline to halothermal circulation, attenuating the
   thermal stratification of the water column and thus providing
   opportunities for enhanced vertical migration of marine taxa.

   contains following species: L. amurensis (Wasmann 1897), L. kozlovi sp.
   nov., L. schneideri Maruyama & Hlavac, 2005 and L. suensoni (Bernhauer
   1936). The synonymy of L. ganglbaueri uralensis (Bernhauer 1936) to L.
   amurensis is confirmed. L. suensoni (Bernhauer, 1936) is revalidated as
   a good species from a synonymy of L. amurensis.

   Fujian, China is described from the female, illustrated and diagnosed
   from its congeners. Description of the final stadium larva of the new
   species is also provided. The new species is closely similar to female
   I. victor. There are a series of relatively minor colour and pattern
   differences between these two female adults, as well as a series of
   obvious structural differences in larvae of these two species. The
   female adult of the new species can be separated from that of I. victor
   by the following characters: (1) labrum entirely yellow; (2) distal end
   of ventral synthorax entirely yellow; (3) abdominal S1-2 with complete
   middorsal yellow stripe; (4) valvula vulvae pointed triangularly, not
   projecting beyond apical border of 8th tergite. The larva of the new
   species can be separated from that of I. victor by the following
   characters: (1) body dark brown, covered with dense long hairs; (2)
   apical border of prementum with 10 spiniform setae on each side; (3)
   premental setae 5+3/5+3; (4) numerous fine bristles present on median
   lobe; (5) inner margin of palpal lobe with 6 large projections; and (6)
   movable hook long and acuminate.

AB Four new species, Stenopsyche tianlinensis sp. nov., S. bistratosa sp.
   nov., both from Guangxi, S. cervaria sp. nov., from Guizhou, and S.
   sinuolata sp. nov., from Shaanxi are described and illustrated. All type
   specimens are deposited in the Insect Collection of Nanjing Agricultural
   University. Stenopsyche tianlinensis sp. nov. (Figs 1 - 4, 17) Length of
   head 1.0 - 1.5 mm. Length of forewing 23.0 - 23.5 mm. The new species
   belongs to Stenopsyche pubescens group. It is similar to S. fissa Navas,
   1932, but the male genitalia of new species differ from those of the
   latter in: 1) the lateral processes of segment IX in new species are
   short and obtuse, but are acute in the latter; 2) in dorsal view,
   intermediate appendages of the new species are nipple-like, but they are
   slender lobes and obviously pointed downwards in the latter. Etymology.
   The specific epithet is from the Chinese name of type locality,
   "Tianlin". Holotype [male], Guangxi Province, Tianlin County, Laoshan
   Forest, 5 June 2002, collected by JIANG Guo-Fang. Paratype 1 [male],
   same data as holotype. Stenopsyche cervaria sp. nov. (Figs 5 - 8, 18)
   Length of head 1.0 - 1.5 mm. Length of forewing 21.0 - 21.5 mm. The new
   species belongs to Stenopsyche martynovi group, and it is easily
   diagnosed by the shape of the intermediate appendages, especially when
   viewed dorsally. Etymology. The specific name is derived from Latin word
   cervarius, meaning rangiferoid, referring to the shape of the
   intermediate appendages in dorsal view. Holotype [male], Guizhou
   Province, Fangjing Mount, Management Station of Heiwan Lake (alt. 530
   m), 8 June 1995, collected by SUN Chang-Hai and WANG Bei-Xin. Paratype 1
   [male], same data as holotype. Stenopsyche bistratosa sp. nov. (Figs 9 -
   12, 19) Length of head 2.5 - 3.0 mm. Length of forewing 27.5 - 28.0 mm.
   The new species belongs to S. apiguna group, and it resembles S. apiguna
   Schmid, 1969 in the shape of superior arms, but can be diagnosed by: 1)
   segment X of the new species divided into an upper layer and a lower
   one, in dorsal view lower layer is tonguelike, longer than upper layer,
   but in the latter, segment X is not divided, only with its distal end
   somewhat trifurcate; 2) intermediate appendages of the new species in
   dorsal view each with a fingerlike lobe on lateral margin, rather than
   with two fingerlike lobes on lateral margin as in the latter. Etymology.
   The specific epithet is from Latin prefix bi-, meaning two or double and
   Latin word stratosus, meaning layered, referring to segment X of the new
   species divided into an upper layer and a lower one. Holotype [male],
   Guangxi Province, Tianlin County, Weihuo Laoshan Forest (alt. 1 400 m),
   4 June 2002, collected by YANG Xiu-Juan. Paratypes: 2 [male] [male],
   Guangxi Province, Tianlin County, Laoshan Forest (alt. 1 300 m), 4 June

   Tianlin County, Laoshan Forest (alt. 1 400 m), 4 June 2002, collected by
   YANG Xiu-Juan. Stenopsyche sinuolata sp. nov. (Figs 13 - 16, 20) Length
   of head 1.5 - 2.0 mm. Length of forewing 26.5 - 27.0 mm. The male
   genitalia of the new species are similar to those of S. triangularis
   Schmid, 1959, but differ in: 1) the lateral processes of segment IX in
   new species acute and curved upwards, but in the latter they are
   straight and slender; 2) intermediate appendages in new species each
   with a small, setae bearing lobe and a digitate process posterior to it,
   but in the latter each with only digitate process. Etymology. The
   specific epithet is from Latin word sinuolatus, meaning curved,
   referring to the lateral processes of segment I acute and curved
   upwards. Holotype [male], Shaanxi Province, Ningshan County, Xunyangba
   Town, Southeastern 8 kin, Xiangtan Brook (alt. 1 520 m), 6 June 1998,
   collected by YANG Lian-Fang and John C. Morse. Paratypes: 3 [male]

   be distinguished from other Photurids by the combination of its small
   size, oval body shape, the dense pubescent appearance of the elytra, and
   flash pattern. Adults emerge at night from Sphagnum spp. hummocks in
   acidic peatland floodplain forests and fly slowly among dense understory
   vegetation at <2m height. Typical flash pattern is a slow signal (0.4 -
   0.8 sec) of moderate luminosity for a Photuris repeated at 3 - 7 sec
   intervals. The species is known only from three sites in two watersheds
   in Sussex County, Delaware.

AB The objective of this study was to identify the helminth fauna in
   hybrid, non-native marmosets, through analysis of fecal samples. The
   study involved 51 marmosets (genus Callithrix) from five groups living
   in places with levels of human impact in Vicosa-MG. The marmosets were
   caught using a multiple-entrance trap and were anaesthetized. Feces were
   collected, refrigerated and analyzed by means of the sedimentation
   technique (Hoffmann-Pons-Janner). Eggs and parasites were identified,
   but not counted. Most of the marmosets (86%) were parasitized by at
   least one genus of helminths. Among the infected marmosets, 37%
   presented co-infection. The intestinal helminths comprised four
   different taxa: Primasubulura jacchi, Ancylostomatidae, Prosthenorchis
   sp. and Dilepididae. P. jacchi and Ancylostomatidae had higher
   prevalences (> 80% and > 40%, respectively) and were found in all
   marmoset groups. Dilepididae species were found in almost all the
   groups, but only accounted for around 30% of the marmosets.
   Prosthenorchis sp. showed a relatively low prevalence (< 10%) and was
   only found in one group. Although two parasites are commonly found in
   marmosets and other Primates (P. jacchi and Prosthenorchis sp.), our
   study is the first record for Ancylostomatidae and Dilepididae. Factors
   like marmosets' feeding behavior and their contact with humans and other
   species of nonhuman Primates seem to be determinants of infection among
   marmosets.

   19 patinga), B, a growout farm (n = 35 patinga) and C, a fee-fishing
   property (n = 28 pacu / n = 7 patinga). Thirty-five fish from each
   property were collected from February 2010 to February 2011 and
   subjected to parasitological analysis. The parasites found were the
   following: Mymarothecium viatorum, Anacanthorus penilabiatus,
   Notozothecium janauachensis (Dactylogyridae, Monogenea), Trichodina
   spp., Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Chilodonella sp. (Protozoa),

   62.9% from "A" and 100% from "B" and "C" were infested with at least one
   parasite species. Pacu fish (n = 44) showed a higher susceptibility to
   Anacanthorus penilabiatus infestations, whereas patinga (n = 61) were
   more susceptible to Mymarothecium viatorum (p < 0.05). Appropriate fish
   handling (nutrition, transport and storage), in conjunction with
   monitoring of water quality, can reduce the stress to which the farmed

AB AlitocorisSailer, 1950, consists of four valid species described from

   was considered paraphyletic in the HerrichellaDistant, 1911, group of
   taxa. The present study provides a cladistic analysis of the Herrichella
   clade, using 88 morphological characters and 40 taxa representing 21
   genera of Ochlerini, including all known species of Alitocoris plus 16
   new species. Outgroups included Eritrachys bituberculataRuckes, 1959,
   Phereclus plutoStal, 1862, and Adoxoplatys comisBreddin, 1903, with the
   last used for rooting. The cladistic analysis was conducted using TNT
   under heuristic searches and implied weighting of characters; 11K-values
   calculated for an average character fit ranged from 50 to 90% of a
   perfectly hierarchical character. The results corroborated the paraphyly
   of Alitocoris, calling for changes in the classification of the genus
   with the proposition of three new genera for two, three, and ten
   species, respectively, that will be described elsewhere. Alitocoris is

AB Cryptic diversity represents a major challenge to the accurate
   assessment of biodiversity, but the combined use of genetic and
   morphological analyses has proven to be a powerful approach to detect
   it. This is especially important for groups for which genetic
   information is not yet available. Here, we studied the highly
   conspicuous habitat-forming Pyura stolonifera species complex
   (Tunicata), which, as has recently been revealed, shows surprising
   levels of cryptic diversity, but whose systematics and biogeographical
   patterns in Australasia nonetheless remain poorly understood. We first
   present detailed taxonomic information of all the species associated
   with the P.stolonifera species complex. We then proceed to describe the
   results of an exhaustive survey that included south-east Australia,
   Tasmania, and New Zealand. Subsequently, we present morphological and
   mitonuclear genetic analysis of two unresolved lineages that comprise
   the species Pyura praeputialis and a species that is formally described
   here (Pyura doppelgangerasp. nov.). Although the ranges of these two
   species overlap on mainland Australia, we found no sites at which both
   species live in sympatry, and there was no morphological or genetic
   evidence of hybridization. Taken together, the present study illustrates
   the usefulness of a combined morphogenetic approach in unravelling
   overlooked marine diversity in a relatively well-studied

AB Wolbachia is a cytoplasmically inherited bacterium which occurs widely
   in the reproductive tissues of arthropods. It causes a wide range of
   alterations to host reproduction, including induction of cytoplasmic
   incompatibility (CI), parthenogenesis induction (PT), genetic male
   feminization and male mortality. We examined the presence of Wolbachia
   in four American gall wasps, Callirhytis punctate Bassett, Dryocosmus
   palustris Osten Sacken, Antistrophus silphii Gillette and Antistrophus
   sp., using polymerase chain reaction and sequence determination of the
   Wolbachia wsp gene. Wolbachia infection rates were found to be 60% and
   36%, in C. punctate and D. palustris, respectively, but no infection was
   detected in the two Antistrophus species. The two wsp sequences of C.
   punctata and D. palustris have lengths of 564 bp and 561 bp,
   respectively, and were 94% similar. Further comparison with known imp
   gene sequences in other cynipid wasps revealed a 100% similarity with
   those in C. punctata and Andricus solitarius (strain 1), Neuroterus
   macropterus and Synergus crassicornis and a similarity ranging between
   79% - 99% in the remaining species. Phylogenic reconstruction of the
   relationships of Wolbachia strains in Cynipidae with known wsp sequences
   indicated that the Wolbachia strain of Callirhytis punctata is closely
   related to that of A. solitarius (strain 1), N. macropterus, Biorhiza
   pallida, and S. crassicornis, whereas the Wolbachia strain of D.
   palustris is closely related to that of A. mairei. Addition of the new
   wsp sequences did not change Wolbachia's established pattern of
   association in cynipid wasps, i.e., the Wolbachia strain of Ceroptres
   cerri belongs to the B group whereas that of all other species belong to
   the A group. Additionally, we used the sexually reproductive generation
   to examine the presence of Wolbachia both in C. punctate and D.
   palustris. The results indicate that Wolbachia does not induce
   parthenogenesis in these species.

   Brazil. Information on frugivorous flies in cultivated or wild host
   plants and their parasitoids in the Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone in
   Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul is presented and discussed. Fruit fly
   samples were collected weekly in specific fruit trees, and
   McPhail[registered trademark] traps were installed in the same trees for
   a period of two years. The fruit flies infested ripe and unripe fruits
   of Averrhoa carambola L., Schoepfia sp., Psidium guajava L. and Pouteria
   torta (Mart.) Radlk and mature fruits of Anacardium occidentale L. and
   Inga laurina (Sw.) Wild. Nineteen fruit fly species were obtained with
   the combination of sampling methods (collecting fruits and trapping),
   nine of them obtained with both methods, five found only in fruits and
   five only in traps. This is the first record of Anastrepha striata
   Schiner in a species of Sapotaceae, as well as for A. castanea Norrbom
   and A. daciformes Bezzi in Schoepfia sp. (Olacaceae), and for A.
   distincta Greene in fruits of P. guajava in the state of Mato Grosso do
   Sul. Fruit collections simultaneously associated with capture of fruit
   flies by McPhail traps in the same host plants are essential to
   understand the diversity of fruit flies and their relationship with
   hosts and parasitoids. Species of Braconidae and Pteromalidae were
   recovered, where Doryctobracon areolatus (Szepligeti) was the most
   abundant parasitoid in larvae of tephritids infesting both cultivated
   and wild host fruits.

AB We report 4800+ late-Holocene, non-passerine avian fossils from Trouing
   Jean Paul, a high-elevation limestone sinkhole in the Morne La Visite
   region, Massif de la Selle, Haiti. The fossils represent prey remains of
   two extant owls, the widespread Tyto alba and the Hispaniolan endemic T.
   glaucops. Among 23 species of birds, only one is extinct (an undescribed
   woodcock, Scolopax new sp.). Two other species (the petrel Pterodroma
   hasitata, and the Hispaniolan endemic pauraque Siphonorhis brewsteri)
   are rare today, the latter now found mainly in dry forest at lower
   elevations. Two other species (the doves Zenaida aurita and Columbina
   passerina) are widespread and common today on Hispaniola (and elsewhere)
   but no longer occur at high elevations. The age of the bone deposit at
   Trouing Jean Paul (c. 1600-600 cal. BP) is based on six radiocarbon
   dates from individual bones of the extinct woodcock. The only other
   extinct Hispaniolan vertebrate with multiple direct radiocarbon dates is
   the sloth Neocnus comes, with the youngest of seven dates (from five
   sites) being c. 5000 cal. BP. The fossil assemblage at Trouing Jean Paul
   does not include the extinct species found in older Holocene sites, such
   as Neocnus comes and associated species (three other sloths, two
   monkeys, four rodents, a caracara, flightless rail, and giant barn-owl).
   Rather, the Trouing Jean Paul fossils portray a late-Holocene bird
   community that already had experienced four or more millennia of
   Amerindian presence, but had not yet been influenced by the activities
   of European or African peoples over the past 500 years. Although only c.
   1000 years old, the Trouing Jean Paul bird community has species
   associations without a modern analog, even if the extinct woodcock is
   excluded.

   King & H. Rob. weed support as an alternate host of this pest during off
   season of cashew. Biology of H. theivora on this weed was studied for
   the first time. The incubation period of eggs was 10.5 [plus or minus]
   1.2 d. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th nymphal instar developmental times
   were 36.11 [plus or minus] 9.52, 43.29 [plus or minus] 7.35, 27.15 [plus
   or minus] 8.41, 41.31 [plus or minus] 10.13, and 73.91 [plus or minus]
   5.67 h, respectively. Survival percentage of eggs was lower (60.53%)
   than nymphal instars. Adult females and males lived for 22.6 [plus or
   minus] 3.29 and 11.8 [plus or minus] 1.64 d, respectively. Females
   showed dynamic patterns of fecundity with the number of eggs laid per
   female ranging 19 to 34. Longevity and fecundity of H. theivora on this
   weed were significantly lesser when compared on cashew. Egg parasitoids
   viz., Telenomus sp., Chaetostricha sp. and Erythmelus helopeltidis Gahan
   were recorded from H. theivora eggs on C. odorata for the first time.
   For better management decisions, it is important to know about this
   mirid biology, particularly their life cycle on their alternate hosts so
   that the right assessment can be made before taking up spray.

   the most important zoonotic digenean with wide geographic distribution
   in the world. The purpose of the present study was to describe
   morphological and morphometrical characteristics of Acanthocolpus
   species, currently prevalent in marine fish fauna of Puri coast, Orissa,
   India. Methods: Gastro-intestinal organs of Leiognathus daura (Cuvier)
   in Puri coast, Orissa, India, were examined for infectivity with
   digenean trematode species. For examination and measurements of
   helminthes, acetoalum carmine staining was performed, followed by camera
   Lucida drawings of morphological characters and measurements of
   morphometrical criteria with a calibrated microscope. Using valid
   trematode systematic keys, almost all the parasites were identified at
   the level of species. Results: Overall, 36 marine fishes were found
   infected with at least one species of Acanthocolpus. Considering
   morphological characteristics of Acanthocolpus, two species were
   identified as new species including Acanthocolpus durghai sp. nov. and
   Acanthocolpus amrawatai sp. nov. Conclusion: During the survey of
   helminth parasites, collected six different species of the genus
   Acanthocolpus, out of these two are new species, another is redescribed
   to show certain variation, the new parasite was obtain from the

   Formations were studied in 4 sections. Their ostracode content includes
   the recognition of 70 species belonging to 34 genera. One species is
   considered as new (Spinoleberis grosdidieri n. sp.). The vertical
   distribution of the ostracodes in the sections enables the detection of
   four local biostratigraphic zones with a Barren Interzone in between. In
   terms of paleobathymetry, each studied sequence reveals deposition on a
   shallow reefal carbonate platform of less than 100 m depth. The
   flourishing of cytherellids in repeated intervals refers to kenoxic
   events within the Cenomanian section. These events are enhanced just
   below the Cenomanian Turonian boundary referring to the Oceanic Anoxic
   Event 2. The wide paleobiogeographic distribution of the recorded
   Cenomanian ostracodes reveals that there was a direct connection
   throughout the Southern Tethyan Realm countries. Also, there was a
   migration path between the Southern Tethyan bioprovince and the West
   African bioprovince during the Cenomanian via the Trans-Saharan Seaway

AB Hyaenodontida are represented in Europe by three subfamilies:
   Proviverrinae, Arfianinae and Sinopaninae. Here, we review all the
   specimens of Arfianinae and Sinopaninae known to date in Europe and
   Asia. A new Galecyon species is erected: Galecyon gallus nov. sp. We
   discuss the taxonomic position of the two Asian hyaenodontidans
   Anthracoxyaena palustris and Arfia langebadreae; the genus
   Anthracoxyaena is synonymized with Arfia. The analysis of the European
   and Asian arfianines and sinopanines provides new data concerning the
   dispersals and faunal events that occurred during the Early Eocene in
   Laurasia. The Arfianinae and Sinopaninae appeared in Europe around the
   Paleocene/Eocene boundary (reference-level MP7). The sinopanines are
   widespread in Europe; they are known in Dormaal (Belgium,
   reference-locality of the level MP7), Rians, Soissons, Pourcy, Try, Le
   Quesnoy (France), and Abbey Wood (England). The analysis of the
   paleogeographic distribution of all Oxyaenodonta and Hyaenodontida at
   and after the MP7 supports the existence of two European provinces: the
   North Province and Mesogean Province. We show that the Arfianinae and
   Sinopaninae rapidly disappeared from Europe; they are unknown in Avenay
   (reference-locality of the level MP8+9) and younger localities. Their
   disappearance from Europe is synchronous with that of the Oxyaenodonta.
   These observations support the existence of a faunal turnover, which
   occurred between the reference-levels MP7 (Dormaal) and MP8+9 (Avenay).
   The hypothesis of a dispersal from Europe to North America during the
   Paleocene-Eocene transition for the Arfianinae and Sinopaninae is
   supported. Moreover, the study of Arfianinae supports a dispersal from
   Europe to Asia around the PIE boundary, followed by a short period of
   endemic evolution. However, our study does not support a close
   relationship between Arfia and the "Arfia-like South Asian
   Proviverrinae" (Kyawdawia, Indohyaenodon, Paratritemnodon and Yarshea).

   Unsurprisingly, given the antiquity of the taxa involved, placement in a

   decision for its placement was doubtful between. Bethylinae, for its
   more complete venation, and Epyrinae for the lack of clypeal
   mid-longitudinal carina or insertion, lack of propodeal anterior
   constriction, and lack of posterolateral spines (highlighting the doubts
   about the validity of Epyrinae as currently defined). However, the

   identified during the analysis of 57 samples from the Miocene Itahana
   Formation (ca. 11.0 to 10.5 Ma) in the Tomioka district, Gunma
   Prefecture, central Japan. Two assemblages were recognized in the lower
   member of the Itahana Formation: Assemblage I is characterized by Aurila
   joushuensis, Loxoconcha nozokiensis, Paracytheridea neolongicaudata,
   Callistocythere spp., and Cythere omotenipponica; Assemblage II is
   characterized by Krithe sp., Acanthocythereis sp., Ambtonia takayasui,
   Ambtonia tamayuensis, and Argilloecia sp. Assemblage II indicates a
   depositional environment of muddy bottoms in the upper bathyal open sea,
   while for the species of Assemblage I a habitat of sandy bottoms in warm
   shallow open seas is indicated, suggesting that the depositional
   environment of the lowermost Itahana Formation was bathyal and that the
   ostracods of Assemblage I were transported to that environment by
   turbidity currents. Fifteen new species are described in this study.

   still not well understood. Among the more controversial of Mesozoic
   eutherians is Paranyctoides Fox, which was described in 1979 from the
   Judithian Dinosaur Park Formation, Alberta, Canada. It is a rare taxon
   and therefore has been identified in only a few other North American
   Late Cretaceous local faunas since. Within the past decade, dental and
   gnathic remains discovered in Central Asia have also been referred to
   Paranyctoides, thereby expanding the geographic range of the genus
   substantially and making it the only Late Cretaceous eutherian
   ostensibly occurring in both continents. As a result of our detailed
   study of Paranyctoides, however, we find that the Central Asian species
   lack the diagnostic characters of Paranyctoides and must be referred to
   other taxa. We conclude that this genus was limited to North America,
   ranging from Aquilan to Lancian time, and accordingly we recognize as
   valid only the following species: Paranyctoides sternbergi (Judithian,
   Alberta), P. maleficus (Aquilan, Alberta), Paranyctoides Wahweap sp. A
   and sp. B (Judithian, Utah), Paranyctoides Kaiparowits sp. A and sp. B

AB The rock agama, Laudakia caucasia Eichwald (Agamidae) is host to
   Plasmodium caucasica sp. n. and Saurocytozoon agamidorum sp. n. in
   western Pakistan. Plasmodium caucasica is characterized by very large
   meronts, 11-21 by 8-17 [mu]m that produce 32-67 merozoites, which nearly
   fill the host erythrocyte, and smaller, ovoid to elongate gametocytes,
   6-14 by 2.5-6 [mu]m, with length by width (LW) 21-55 [mu]m2, and L/W
   ratio 1.0-4.0. Host cells are usually mature erythrocytes. In
   Azerbaijan, P caucasica parasitizes immature erythroid cells. Dimensions
   of meronts are 10-16 by 6-12 [mu]m, and merozoite numbers are 12-44.
   Gametocytes are 6-14 by 3-6 [mu]m, with LW 31-56 [mu]m2, and L/W ratio
   1.0-4.0. Saurocytozoon agamidorum sp. n. gametocytes are 6.5-13 [mu]m in
   diameter, with LW 35-79 [mu]m2, and L/W ratio 1.0-2.2. They occupy
   lymphocytes as host cells, which are greatly distorted by gametocyte
   presence and often show nuclei nearly divided into two portions, one
   portion at each end of the cell. Haemocystidium grahami (Shortt, 1922),
   redescribed from material found in L. caucasia from Azerbaijan, has
   rounded to elongate gametocytes, 8-19.5 by 4-8 [mu]m, LW 60.5-102
   [mu]m2, and L/W ratio 1.0-4.5. The prominent light golden pigment
   granules often coalesce to nearly cover the surface of the gametocyte.
   The presence of P. caucasica and S. agamidorum extends the range of the
   two genera in saurian hosts throughout much of the southern Asia
   mainland.

AB The fossil ibis Plegadis paganus is known from the Early Miocene of the
   Saint-Gerand-le-Puy area, France. It was first described in the 19th
   century by Milne-Edwards (1867-1868), who noticed similarities with
   members of the extant genera Eudocimus and Plegadis, a view endorsed by
   subsequent descriptions. The fossil's present placement within the genus
   Plegadis is not supported by synapomorphic features, and important
   differences with members of this genus have been noted in the past. The
   present analysis demonstrates that retention of P.paganus in the extant
   genus Plegadis is no longer justified, and it is therefore referred to
   the new genus Gerandibis. A phylogenetic analysis of 55 osteological
   characters supports placement of Gerandibis pagana in a clade together
   with Neotropical taxa. This analysis also allowed for an evaluation of
   the relationships among extant threskiornithids. Contrary to results
   obtained in molecular-based phylogenies, the present analysis supports a
   basal divergence of crown group Threskiornithidae into a clade
   comprising Threskiornis and Platalea and a clade comprising all other
   ibises. Within the latter, two clades, one made up of Old World taxa and
   the other consisting predominantly of New World taxa, were recovered.

   spines on the merus and carpus of the anterior pereopods. The high
   diversity of Tanaidacea in Australian waters is discussed. In
   particular, we conclude that Australian coasts suffer a diversity of
   immigration routes, have sufficient marine longevity, and afford such a
   diversity of available niches to have allowed multiple colonization and

   described as a new genus and species of the family Ophiacanthidae:
   Leadagmara gracilispina. The new form constitutes the oldest unequivocal
   representative of this extant ophiuroid family, significantly extending
   its stratigraphical range. The first cladistic analysis of the
   Ophiacanthidae including all extant genera suggests L. gracilispina
   holds a basal, but not the basalmost, position within the family,
   forming a sister group with the extant Ophiomedea and Ophiopristis to
   the other ophiacanthids except for Ophiologimus, which itself is sister
   to all other ophiacanthids. These results imply that ophiacanthids
   originated in the pre-Carnian. A critical re-evaluation of the
   ophiacanthid fossil record reveals that the vast majority of records
   consist of dissociated lateral arm plates, which provide no insights
   into divergence times of the lineages. Among the few records of
   articulated specimens, only Inexpectacantha acrobatica from the
   Pliensbachian of France proved sufficiently well-known to yield
   phylogenetically relevant information. Its position within the
   ophiacanthid clade indicates that more than half of the extant

   western coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia, are widely known for the
   well-preserved fossil remains of marine organisms, including a diverse
   assemblage of primarily benthic and demersal teleost fishes.
   [dagger]Sakhalinia multispinata, gen et sp. nov., a new cottoid fish
   from the Miocene (Serravallian-Tortonian) finely laminated sandstone of
   the Agnevo Formation, is described herein based on a single, nearly
   complete specimen in part and counterpart. Several morphological
   features indicate that [dagger]Sakhalinia multispinata is a basal member
   of the cottoid family Hexagrammidae. Within hexagrammids,
   [dagger]Sakhalinia multispinata exhibits a unique combination of
   features and is primarily typified by slender and recurved jaw teeth, 44
   (22 + 22) vertebrae, 14 (6 + 8) principal caudal fin rays, a moderate
   consolidation of the caudal skeleton, an entire dorsal fin with 25 thick
   spines and 13 soft rays, anal fin with four strong spines and 12 soft
   rays, and ctenoid scales. The elongated, slender, and recurved jaw teeth
   displayed by [dagger]Sakhalinia multispinata suggest that this
   hexagrammid fish was specialized to feed mainly on small crustaceans.

   of the Sulphur Mountain Formation in east-central British Columbia,

   Grippia cf. longirostris or Parvinatator wapitiensis. More recently, the
   part slab of TMP 89.127.3 was collected and prepared, revealing
   important new cranial data that permits its systematic relationships to
   be more thoroughly assessed and previously proposed taxonomic affinities
   to be tested. By integrating both cranial and postcranial data,
   phylogenetic analysis recovers TMP 89.127.3 and Grippia as members of
   Grippidia, nested within Eoichthyosauria. TMP 89.127.3 can be
   distinguished from Grippia by possessing the following autapomorphies:
   metacarpal I with a notched peripheral shaft; cylindrical anterior teeth
   with a crown shape index >5.0; and a postfrontal-frontal contact at the
   rostral limit of the anterior margin of the supratemporal terrace. A new
   taxon, Gulosaurus helmi, is erected to accommodate this suite of
   features. The placement of Gulosaurus helmi within Grippidia reaffirms
   the Early Triassic distribution of this clade to include western and
   northern Laurasia, which is represented by outcrop in present-day Canada
   and Norway (Spitzbergen), respectively.

   Austria (early Late Triassic: late Carnian) was previously identified as
   a new species of phytosaurian archosauriform, Francosuchus' trauthi.
   Francosuchus' trauthi was subsequently synonymized with the
   non-phytosaurid phytosaur Paleorhinus, and this synonymy was used as
   evidence to correlate the Paleorhinus biochron' and the Otischalkian
   land-vertebrate faunachron to the marine timescale. Here, I provide a
   redescription of Francosuchus' trauthi and document anatomical features
   that differ substantially from all known species of non-phytosaurid
   phytosaur. There is no evidence to support synonymy of Francosuchus'
   trauthi with Paleorhinus, and no unambiguous features to support a
   phytosaurian identification. However, Francosuchus' trauthi possesses a
   unique combination of characters that distinguish it from all other
   Triassic tetrapods, and necessitates referral of the species to a new
   genus, Dolerosaurus, gen. nov. Rejection of the proposed synonymy
   between Francosuchus' trauthi and Paleorhinus means that the Paleorhinus
   biochron' cannot be tied to the marine late Carnian as previously
   suggested, and provides further evidence of the problems inherent in
   attempting to correlate the terrestrial Triassic to the marine
   timescale.

   functional morphology, taxonomy and evolution; little attention has been
   paid to its ontogeny. Here, we map population variation by principal
   component analysis for over 80 specimens distributed across five species
   of Dicoelosia. Using geometric morphometrics with landmarks for some 40
   specimens, the ontogenic trends in D. sp. nov. are compared with those
   of Dicoelosiabiloba. In addition, the ontogenic pathway in D. sp. nov.
   is investigated by morphing with control points, a new technique
   introduced here to palaeontology. Combining the results above, the
   ontogeny of the key character of the genus, emargination, is modelled.
   Within single populations, taxa may develop from broad weakly emarginate
   forms into those that are elongate and deeply emarginate. As the
   identification of the genus and its species depends on external
   morphological characters, the definition of ontogenetic trends in each
   species is essential for taxonomic discrimination. Substantial
   population variation exists in many of its species; however, the
   morphing technique provides a method of simulation, predicting the full
   range of ontogenetic variation in given populations.

   cichlid radiations (EARs) as well as to globally important aquaculture
   species. We present a comprehensive molecular phylogeny of
   representative haplotilapiine cichlids, combining in one data set four
   mitochondrial and five nuclear loci for 76 species, and compare it with
   phylogenetic information of a second data set of 378 mitochondrial ND2
   haplotypes representing almost all important "Tilapia" or
   Tilapia-related lineages as well as most EAR lineages. The monophyly of
   haplotilapiines is supported, as is the nested sister group relationship
   of Etia and mouthbrooding tilapiines with the remaining haplotilapiines.
   The latter are consistently placed in eight monophyletic clades over all
   datasets and analyses, but several dichotomous phylogenetic
   relationships appear compromised by cytonuclear discordant phylogenetic
   signal. Based on these results as well as on extensive morphological
   evidence we propose a novel generic and suprageneric classification

   tribes. New tribes are provided for the former subgenera Coptodon

AB Myxosporeans (Myxozoa) are eukaryotic parasites, primarily of fish,
   whose classification is in a state of flux as taxonomists attempt to
   synthesize the traditional morphology-based system with emerging DNA
   sequence-based phylogenies. The genus Sphaerospora Thelohan, 1892, which
   includes pathogenic species that cause significant impacts on fisheries
   and aquaculture, is one of the most polyphyletic taxa and exemplifies
   the current challenges facing myxozoan taxonomists. The type species, S.
   elegans, clusters within the Sphaerospora sensu stricto clade, members
   of which share similar tissue tropism and long insertions in their
   variable rRNA gene regions. However, other morphologically similar
   sphaerosporids lie in different branches of myxozoan phylogenetic trees.
   Herein, we significantly extend taxonomic sampling of sphaerosporids
   with SSU + LSU rDNA and EF-2 sequence data for 12 taxa including three
   representatives of the morphologically similar genus Polysporoplasma
   Sitja-Bobadilla et Alvarez-Pellitero, 1995. These taxa were sampled from
   different vertebrate host groups, biogeographic realms and environments.
   Our phylogenetic analyses and statistical tests of single and
   concatenated datasets revealed Sphaerospora s. s. as a strongly
   supported monophyletic lineage, that clustered sister to the whole
   myxosporean clade (freshwater + marine lineages). Generally,
   Sphaerospora s. s. rDNA sequences (up to 3.7 kb) are the longest of all
   myxozoans and indeed metazoans. The sphaerosporid clade has two
   lineages, which have specific morphological, biological and sequence
   traits. Lineage A taxa (marine Sphaerospora spp.) have a single
   binucleate sporoplasm and shorter AT-rich rDNA inserts. Lineage B taxa
   (freshwater/brackish Sphaerospora spp. + marine/brackish Polysporoplasma
   spp.) have 2-12 uninucleate sporoplasms and longer GC-rich rDNA inserts.
   Lineage B has four subclades that correlate with host group and habitat;
   all Polysporoplasma species, including the type species, cluster
   together in one of these subclades. We thus suppress the genus
   Polysporoplasma and the family Polysporoplasmidae and emend the generic
   diagnosis of the genus Sphaerospora. The combination of morphological,
   biological and DNA sequence data applied in this study helped to
   elucidate an important part of the taxonomic puzzle within the phylum
   Myxozoa. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   as well as a symmetrical depression on its dorsal surface at the nexus
   of the parietal rami. This depression is interpreted to be the
   attachment point for a second midline epiparietal. This parietal
   morphology is distinct from that exhibited by Anchiceratops or
   Pentaceratops. The posterior midline epiparietal in B. polyphemus and
   its bifurcated quadratojugal-squamosal joint are features shared with
   the most derived chasmosaurines, Torosaurus and Triceratops. The
   combination of primitive and derived traits exhibited by B. polyphemus,
   and its stratigraphic position, is compatible with the gradual
   transition from basal, to intermediate, to derived chasmosaurines
   observed throughout the western interior of North America, and with
   phylogenetic analysis, which suggests that Bravoceratops may be closely
   related to Coahuilaceratops.

AB The stratigraphy and the ammonite fauna of the Vaca Muerta and Picun
   Leufu formations outcropping along the transect Portada Covunco-Cerrito
   Caracoles (south-central Neuquen Basin) were studied by means of two
   representative sections. The detailed study of the lithological
   succession of the two sections has allowed to complete the formal
   subdivision of the Vaca Muerta Formation by the introduction of two new
   members: the Portada Covunco Member (nov.) at the base, and the Pichi
   Moncol Member (nov.) at the top; the middle part of the formation is
   currently known as the Los Catutos Member. The ammonite fauna is mainly
   composed by species already recorded in other localities of the basin.
   There are six new species, but they remain to be formally described
   based on better and more abundant material: Choicensisphinctes cf./aff.
   platyconus, Catutosphinctes aff. rafaeli, Catutosphinctes n. spp. A & B,
   Steueria aff. alternans, and Sutneria n. sp. A. The lowermost Tithonian
   (lower Picunleufuense Zone) is well represented in the section P.
   Covunco by the guide assemblage (Lithacoceras picunleufuense,
   Choicensisphinctes platyconus and Catutosphinctes guenenakenensis) at
   the base of the P. Covunco Mb. The Zitteli Zone (which seems to overlap
   the Mendozanus Zone) and the Proximus Zone occur in the middle and upper
   parts of the P. Covunco Mb, as recongnized by their characteristic
   ammonite assemblages. The upper part of the Middle Tithonian, the
   Internispinosum Zone, corresponds to the Los Catutos Mb and, apparently,
   the upper part of the Vaca Muerta Fm (Pichi Moncol Mb), although it is
   fossiliferous only in its lower part. The lower Upper Tithonian
   Alternans Zone is well documented by ammonites, whereas the upper Upper
   Tithonian yielded only scarce fossils which could even represent the
   lower Berriasian Noduliferum Zone.

   mostly poorly preserved specimens from the Dohlen Basin in eastern

   Germany. Reexamination of this material demonstrates that the referred
   specimen differs from the type material, and it is named Batropetes
   niederkirchensis n. sp. in this study. The two species differ in the
   shape of the prefrontal and postorbital, the width of the interorbital
   region, the number of presacral vertebrae, the degree of ossification of
   the scapulocoracoid, and the position of the obturator foramen. The
   functional interpretation of the skull and the locomotion apparatus
   suggests that the genus was terrestrial, living near the lakes, where
   they are preserved in the sediments.

   September 2010 to June 2011, 66 specimens of the sea bream Pagrus pagrus
   (F: Sparidae) and 43 of the red mullet Mullus barbatus (F: Mullidae)
   were purchased from markets in the Suez and Hurghada cities of the Red
   Sea. The fishes were measured, and their organs investigated for
   helminth infections. Forty-one (37.6 %) out of the 109 fish specimens
   investigated were parasitized with Trypanorhyncha metacestodes,
   identified as Callitetrarhynchus speciouses Linton 1897, Pseudogrillotia
   sp. Dollfus 1969, Kotorella pronosoma Stossich 1901 from P. pagrus, and
   Nybelinia bisulcata Linton 1889 from M. barbatus in the mesentery and
   peritoneal cavity, with prevalences of 16.5, 11.0, 6.0, and 12.0 %. All
   of these larval stages were encapsulated larvae in blastocysts. C.
   speciouses is characterized by an elongated scolex, two bothria, a long
   postbulbosa, and four elongated bulbs. Pseudogrillotia sp. possesses a
   scolex with two lateral patelliform bothridia; posterior margins are
   free, not notched. A long sheath was observed, which was irregularly
   coiled when tentacles invaginated. N. bisulcata possesses an acraspedote
   scolex with four bothridia, which are broad, bean-shaped. The tentacles
   are spirally coiled, supplied with hooks with abruptly turned points.
   The four tentacles sheaths rose from scolex as two anterior (front) and
   two posterior (back) which overlap at the apices of bulbs. K. pronosoma
   is characterized by a short body with a craspedote scolex and four
   bothridia. The tentacles are short and emerge pairwise. The presence of
   Trypanorhyncha metacestodes in the muscles does not represent a risk of
   infection for humans. They have a negative effect on fish esthetics. The
   repugnant aspect and the prohibition for commercial use by sanitary
   inspectors, however, cause consumer rejection. Parasites of the order
   Trypanorhyncha have been recorded in these host fishes for the first
   time.

   species, Prosorhynchus freitasi Nagaty, 1937, are characterised. The
   three species of Neidhartia, Neidhartia haywardi n. sp., Neidhartia
   plectropomi n. sp. and Neidhartia tyleri n. sp. are readily
   distinguishable morphologically. Two of the six species of Prosorhynchus
   (Prosorhynchus lesteri n. sp. and Prosorhynchus wrightae n. sp.) are
   easily distinguished from their other congeners by morphology but the
   other four species (P. freitasi, Prosorhynchus heronensis n. sp.,
   Prosorhynchus munozae n. sp. and Prosorhynchus plectropomi n. sp.) are
   generally similar in morphology and were only distinguished initially by
   comparing their ITS2 rRNA sequences. Three additional taxa, one from the
   GBR and two from French Polynesia, were recognised as distinct on the
   basis that their ITS2 rRNA sequences differed from those of the new taxa
   described here; these species remain unnamed for the present.
   Inter-specific divergence observed within these genera in the ITS2 rRNA
   ranged from 10 to 42 base pairs (4-16 %) for species of Neidhartia and
   2-57 base pairs (3-21 %) for species of Prosorhynchus. Inter-generic
   divergences were 42-55 base pairs (17-21 %). No intraspecific variation
   in the ITS2 rRNA region was observed for any of the six species for
   which multiple sequence replicates were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis
   of 12 operational taxa from Plectropomus together with sequences of
   three other species from epinepheline serranids demonstrated that
   Neidhartia and Prosorhynchus were reciprocally monophyletic with the
   exception that P. wrightae n. sp. fell either within or basal to the
   Neidhartia species. The richness of bucephalids in species of
   Plectropomus appears to be exceptional within the Serranidae relative to
   that observed in other serranid genera in the tropical Indo-West

AB Marine invertebrate fauna associated with whale remains has lately
   attracted a great deal of interest. However, very little is known about
   this fauna in the Southern Ocean, an area with high abundances of
   cetaceans. To investigate the Antarctic organisms associated with these
   substrates, we conducted a study using whale bones in the shallow-waters
   of Deception Island (South Shetland Islands). In this paper, we describe
   two new species of Ophryotrocha (O. orensanzi sp. nov. and O. clava sp.
   nov.) from a minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) fresh caudal
   vertebra experimentally deployed for about a year and from an unknown
   whale vertebra presumably dating back to the early twentieth century
   whaling operations. Ophryotrocha clava sp. nov., found in relative high
   abundance in the fresh bone, is hypothesized to be an opportunistic
   species in the context of Antarctic shallow-water organically enriched
   environments. Ophryotrocha orensanzi sp. nov. appears to be the same
   species as the unnamed Palpiphitime sp., near lobifera, formerly
   reported from a nearby area. Phylogenetic analyses based on the nuclear
   gene H3 and the mitochondrial genes COI and 16S, using MrBayes and
   Maximum Likelihood analyses, show that O. clava sp. nov. is close to
   Iphitime hartmanae and is included in the 'hartmanni' clade, while O.
   orensanzi sp. nov. falls in the 'lobifera' clade. Remarks about their
   feeding preferences and ecology are also given. Our findings seem to
   suggest that members of the genus Ophryotrocha are important components
   of organically enriched Southern Ocean environments, as has been
   reported for this clade in other geographic areas.

AB In a study on the order Trypanorhyncha Diesing, 1863, a total of 35
   specimens belonging to nine species of elasmobranch in the Gulf of Oman,
   was examined. The following trypanorhynch species were identified:
   Pterobothrium lesteri Campbell & Beveridge, 1996, Otobothrium
   carcharidis (Shipley & Hornell, 1906), Eutetrarhynchus platycephali
   Palm, 2004, Parachristianella indonesiensis Palm, 2004, Pa.
   monomegacantha Kruse, 1959 and Prochristianella mooreae Beveridge, 1990.
   Prochristianella garshaspi n. sp. is described from Pastinachus sephen
   (ForsskAyenl) and Rhinoptera sp. The new species is allocated to the
   genus Prochristianella Dollfus, 1946 on the basis of the presence of two
   bothria, prebulbar organs, and a heteroacanthous typical tentacular
   armature with relatively few hooks in each principal row, hollow hooks
   increasing in size from antibothrial and then decreasing towards the
   bothrial surface of the tentacle, hooks 1 and 1' being separated, and a
   basal swelling with characteristic billhooks increasing in size towards
   the bothrial surface. The lack of microscopically visible microtriches
   on the scolex distinguishes the new species from P. hispida (Linton,
   1890), P. clarkeae Beveridge, 1990, P. thalassia (Kovaks & Schmidt,
   1980), P. multidum Friggens & Duszynski, 2005 and P. cairae Schaeffner &
   Beveridge, 2012. Prochristianella garshaspi n. sp. can be distinguished
   from the remaining species within the genus by a combination of the
   following morphological features: the presence of numerous gland-cells
   within the tentacular bulbs, the number of rows on the basal swelling,
   the number of hooks per half spiral row, the size of the principal
   hooks, the number of the testes and the presence of an external seminal
   vesicle.

AB Spiny-backed tree frogs of the genus Osteocephalus are conspicuous
   components of the tropical wet forests of the Amazon and the Guiana
   Shield. Here, we revise the phylogenetic relationships of Osteocephalus
   and its sister group Tepuihyla, using up to 6134bp of DNA sequences of
   nine mitochondrial and one nuclear gene for 338 specimens from eight
   countries and 218 localities, representing 89% of the 28 currently
   recognized nominal species. Our phylogenetic analyses reveal (i) the
   paraphyly of Osteocephalus with respect to Tepuihyla, (ii) the placement
   of Hyla' warreni as sister to Tepuihyla, (iii) the non-monophyly of
   several currently recognized species within Osteocephalus and (iv) the
   presence of low (<1%) and overlapping genetic distances among
   phenotypically well-characterized nominal species (e.g. O.taurinus and
   O.oophagus) for the 16S gene fragment used in amphibian DNA barcoding.
   We propose a new taxonomy, securing the monophyly of Osteocephalus and
   Tepuihyla by rearranging and redefining the content of both genera and
   also erect a new genus for the sister group of Osteocephalus. The
   colouration of newly metamorphosed individuals is proposed as a
   morphological synapomorphy for Osteocephalus. We recognize and define
   five monophyletic species groups within Osteocephalus, synonymize three
   species of Osteocephalus (O.germani, O.phasmatus and O.vilmae) and three
   species of Tepuihyla (T.celsae, T.galani and T.talbergae) and reallocate
   three species (Hyla helenae to Osteocephalus, O.exophthalmus to
   Tepuihyla and O.pearsoni to Dryaderces gen. n.). Furthermore, we flag
   nine putative new species (an increase to 138% of the current
   diversity). We conclude that species numbers are largely underestimated,
   with most hidden diversity centred on widespread and polymorphic nominal
   species. The evolutionary origin of breeding strategies within
   Osteocephalus is discussed in the light of this new phylogenetic
   hypothesis, and a novel type of amplexus (gular amplexus) is described.

AB We comprehensively revise the taxonomy of the camaenid genus
   Mesodontrachia Solem, 1985, which is endemic to the Victoria River
   District and East Kimberley in the north-western Australian Monsoon
   Tropics based on comparative analyses of key morphological features and
   mitochondrial DNA sequences. We examined newly collected samples from
   several collection sites spread over nearly 20000km2 of mostly
   inaccessible land, which represented all three currently known and three
   previously undescribed species. All species were initially identified as
   members of Mesodontrachia based on their similar, putatively typical
   shell. However, Mesodontrachia as so delimited was polyphyletic in a
   mitochondrial phylogeny with respect to several other camaenid genera
   from NW Australia. Contrary to the shell, we found considerable
   variation in the penial anatomy that was consistent with the mtDNA
   differentiation. To retain monophyletic taxa, we propose a revised
   taxonomy whereby Mesodontrachia is maintained as a monotypic taxon. In
   addition, four genera (Nodulabium, Ototrachia, Pseudomesodontrachia and
   Vincentrachia) and three species (P.gregoriana, O.compressa and
   N.solidum) are newly described. The shell of all these taxa is highly
   conserved and of little taxonomic utility. Shell similarity is
   attributed to a similar life style in a similar and harsh environment.

AB Defining the taxonomic identity of organisms is a prerequisite for their
   study, and in the case of economically important species,
   misidentification may lead to the application of inappropriate
   prevention and control strategies. Flat mites of the Brevipalpus genus
   include several crop pests and the systematics of these mites represents
   a challenge for acarologists. Many of the most economically important
   Brevipalpus species have repeatedly been inaccurately identified. Such
   problematic classification has been attributed to the likely occurrence
   of cryptic species in the genus. In this study, we used an integrative
   approach that combined molecular analyses, including sequence-based
   species delimitation, with detailed morphological identification using
   traits that have recently showed to be taxonomically informative.
   Sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) were
   obtained from individuals collected from host plants belonging to 14
   genera and 13 families across 29 locations in the Americas (Brazil,
   Chile, USA). The phylogenetic analyses included previously published
   Brevipalpus sequences from GenBank, and the final data set was
   classified into 44 haplotypes. Six putative species were recognised by
   COI-based species delimitation analysis, and morphological evidence
   supported each of these species. The integrative approach revealed the
   occurrence of cryptic species in the Brevipalpus genus and contributed
   to the clarification of previously noted incongruences. The results
   presented here allow for the evaluation of taxonomic characteristics in
   a phylogenetic context and indicate new characters for the
   differentiation of Brevipalpus species. In addition, Brevipalpus
   incognitus n. sp. Ferragut & Navia, a cryptic species detected in this
   study, is described based on morphological and molecular traits.
   Implications of the advances in Brevipalpus systematics presented herein
   with respect to pest management are briefly discussed.

AB Neofundulus splendidus n. sp. is described from Bolivia, departamento de
   Santa Cruz, rio San Miguel, upper Mamore basin. Neofundulus splendidus
   n. sp. is distinguished from the remaining Neofundulus species by a
   combination of characters: Large black spot at humeral region with
   diameter of approximately 1.5-2.0 of pupil in males and females (vs.
   black spot in humeral region, when present, small- half of pupil), 40-41
   scales in longitudinal series (vs. 35-38 in remaining congeners). This
   is the first record for the genus Neofundulus in rio Mamore basin.

AB Spectrolebias pilleti n. sp. is described from a temporary pool from the
   upper Ho Mamore basin, Departamento Santa Cruz, Quimone city, Bolivia.
   The new species is distinguished from all congeners by the unique color
   pattern of males:3 to 5 vertical blue bars alternating with a light
   reddish brown background in males (vs. absence of bars), by the presence
   of an iridescent blue spot on the flank in female (vs. presence of one
   or more black spots), by the absence of filaments at the tips of dorsal
   fin and anal fin in males, except Spectrolebias reticulatus (vs. long
   filaments on dorsal and anal fins in S. brousseaui and S. filamentosus,
   filaments on the dorsal fins of S. semiocellatus and S. inaequipinnatus,
   or filaments in the anal fins of S. chacoensis) and by the presence of
   scales covering the base of anal fin in males (vs. absence of these
   scales in the remaining congeners). Also distinguished from all
   congeners, with the exception of S. reticulatus, by the position of the
   dorsal fin, which has its origin anterior to the origin of the anal fin
   in males.

AB Hemiscyllium halmahera new species is described from two specimens,
   656-681 mm TL, collected at Ternate, Halmahera, Indonesia. The new
   species is clearly differentiated on the basis of colour pattern. Its
   features include a general brown colouration with numerous clusters of
   mainly 2-3 dark polygonal spots, widely scattered white spots in the
   matrix between dark clusters, relatively few (< 10), large dark spots on
   the interorbital/snout region, a pair of large dark marks on the ventral
   surface of the head, and a fragmented post-cephalic mark consisting of a
   large U-shaped dark spot with a more or less continuous white margin on
   the lower half, followed by a vertical row of three, smaller clusters of
   2-3 polygonal dark marks. The new species is most similar in general
   appearance to H. galei from Cenderawasih Bay, West Papua, which differs
   in having 7-8 large, horizontally elongate dark spots on the lower side
   between the abdomen and caudal-fin base, a cluster of solid dark
   post-cephalic spots, and usually about 25 dark spots on the upper
   surface of the head.

AB A new species of melanotaeniid rainbowfish, Melanotaenia sneideri, is
   described from the Bomberai Peninsula in the southwestern Bird's Head
   region of western New Guinea (West Papua Province, Indonesia). The new
   taxon is described on the basis of 25 specimens, 15.9-80.1 mm SL,
   collected from a karst spring-fed creek in a small ephemeral lake basin
   at an altitude of 1,050 m in the Kumawa Mountains. It is distinguished
   from congeners by a combination of the bright red body colour, dark
   brown to blackish dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins, and relatively deep
   body (to at least 42.3 % of SL) of adult males. Additional diagnostic
   features include 18-20 gill rakers on the first branchial arch, 15-16
   circumpeduncular scales, and an absence of vomerine teeth or a small,
   inconspicuous patch of rudimentary vomerine teeth.

AB A new species, that appears to belong to the gobiid genus
   Egglestonichthys, is described from specimens collected from the shallow
   coast and estuaries of Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory,
   Australia. It is unusual among gobiids in that the lower half of the
   pectoral-fin lacks connecting membrane between the fin rays, so that the
   rays are free (resembling the pectoral fin of the fishes of the family
   Polynemidae). Its closest relative may be E. bombylios Larson and Hoese,
   although its sensory papilla pattern differs from others in the genus. A
   key to the four known species presently placed in Egglestonichthys is

AB Our knowledge of octocoral diversity in the eastern Pacific has been
   focused on shallow reef habitats, while the fauna occurring in the
   mesophotic zone from 40 to 150 m is poorly known. A new species of the
   gorgoniid Eugorgia was recently obtained with a submersible from the
   Hannibal Bank, a coastal seamount 60 km off mainland Panama and 15 km
   from Coiba Island. The morphological characters were analyzed and
   illustrated by light and scanning electron microscopy. Eugorgia
   siedenburgae sp. nov. can be distinguished from the other species in the
   genus by its bushy, multiplanar, bicolored colony, and the sclerites
   colors, composition, and sizes. This new species increases the number in
   the genus to 13 and contributes to our understanding of the fragile
   mesophotic biodiversity.

AB Five specimens of a new species of Uvitellina Witenberg collected from
   the air sacs of a black-winged stilt, Himantopus himantopus, collected
   from the Kherson Region of the Ukraine, were described. Of the 9 species
   in the genus, Uvitellina himantopi n. sp. differs from all other species
   in the ratio of the width to the length of eggs (1:1.8 (1:1.6-1:1.9)
   compared to a low of 1:2.2 in Uvitellina adephis and a high of 1:3.6 in
   Uvitellina teesae). Uvitellina himantopi a. sp. is most similar to
   Uvitellina iraquensis because, unlike the other 4 species in the genus
   with a rudimentary oral sucker (Uvitellina indica, Uvitellina
   kaniharensis, Uvitellina macroisophaga, and U. teesae), these 2 species
   have an oral sucker that is typically wider than the pharynx
   (1:1.0-1:1.2 oral sucker width/pharynx width compared to 1:0.8-1:0.9 in
   the other 4 species) and a similar cirrus sac length (370-400 long (3-4%
   of body length) compared to 300-490 (3-5%)). Uvitellina himantopi n. sp.
   has a larger body than U. iraquensis (12,118-15,100 long compared to
   7,750-10,459), wider eggs (105 maximum width compared to 88), and unlike
   in U. iraquensis, the vitelline fields of U. himantopi n. sp. are
   attenuated posteriorly at their confluence to form a conspicuous,
   posteriorly directed point.
